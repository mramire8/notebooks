1	Only after<br>successfully completing those do you fly with the captians on trips hauling<br>university officials.	If you'll settle for someone who _went_ to an aviation university . . .<br><br>I graduated from Purdue University in 1990 from the School of Aviation<br>Technology.  I went through the maintenance/flight option and graduated with my<br>A&P, CFI, ASMEL, 50 hours of King Air, 85 hours of Mitsubishi Diamond jet, and a<br>B.S. degree.  Purdue offers options in all of the areas you mention.  While it's<br>certainly not a perfect program, I think it is better than average.  To address<br>your individual questions:<br><br>> 1. Are you able to fly enough (VFR) due to weather, and are you able to fly<br>> in IFR conditions also at that college?<br><br>Wasn't too much of a problem.  There are certainly times when VFR courses get a<br>little tight due to WX, but I'd take that trade off for never getting any actual<br>IFR time.<br><br>> 2. Are you able to fly enough due to Aircraft Availability/Maintenance<br><br>Was never an issue.  Equipment is always in excellent condition, top notch staff<br>of mechanics.  The program is extremely selective - only about 60 or so per year<br>in flight, and a few flight/________ to guarantee availability.  They  are not<br>interested in seeing how many people they can crank through, but insuring those<br>in the program have quality instruction.<br><br>> 3. Are you able to get more than enough experience to qualify you to become a<br>> commercial pilot<br><br>That is solely a function of the market at the time you graduate.  When I<br>graduated, things were very  tight and many peole couldn't find work.  Now you<br>could probably have a job waiting when you graduate, but that too will probably<br>change by the time you get out (probably more than once).  They key is to get as<br>much experience as you can whilst in school.  Instruct part-time, fly jumpers,<br>photography, traffic patrol, whatever, so that you have the market requirements<br>or as close to them as possible when you get out.<br><br>> 4.  How is the scheduling system for flying at that college?<br><br>Your flying is a regularly scheduled class slot - you don't have to fight for an<br>airplane most of the time.  There is some extra flying required on weekends -<br>cross country and such, but again with the limited enrollment, it's not too much<br>of an issue.  Most instructors will try and do a few extra sessions to get ahead<br>and preclude trouble finishing up due to WX or checkrides.<br><br>> 5. Instructor Quality and availability<br><br>Instructors are scheduled with you every flight period.  I felt that quality was<br>pretty good.  They have both full time staff, and part-time instructors (who are<br>upperclassmen with their CFI's).  You could always get a bad apple, but all of<br>mine were quite good.  I still use little thoughts my instrument instructor<br>shared with me ten years and over 3000 hours ago.<br><br>> 6. Multi-engine time given<br><br>10 hours to get your MEL.  Additionally, most students get time in the schools<br>King Air C-90 & B-200.  The amount of time varies, I used to be a record holder<br>at around 55 hours.  I think 10-15 is more typical.  It's not just jump in the<br>right seat and run the radios, though.  You first have a two courses on the<br>flight departments proceedures and King Air systems and operations.  Only after<br>successfully completing those do you fly with the captians on trips hauling<br>university officials.  This really is excellent experience.  You may fly into<br>Chicago O'Hare, Washington National, Teterboro, or other major airports.<br>Operations are conducted like a professional flight department, because that's<br>what it is, not just flight instruction.  You certainly will recieve instruction<br>while doing this, but you are also treated as a fellow professional.<br>Additionally, you will fly the aircraft - not just run radios.<br><br>> 7. Class B/C airspace experience<br><br>See above, additionally you will get experience in C airspace while working on<br>all of your ratings.<br><br>> 8. Speed at which the programs are completed<br><br>Private throught Commercial/Instrument Freshman and Sophmore years (and<br>Associates degree).  B-727 Flight Engineer rating (not just the written) along<br>with transport catagory systems, proceedures, operations, and B-727 simulator<br>training (and I hear they are adding a Dornier simulator) during Junior and<br>Senior years.  Some work is required during the one or two summers.<br>Additionally, there is a program I participated in where 6 students a year are<br>sent to FlightSafety and trained and typed in the Beechjet 400A (Diamond when I<br>was there).  The students then fly as FO's for the next year.<br><br>> And are you a freshman, sophomore, junior or senior.<br><br>As I said, I graduated in 1990.  I spent the next several years doing a<br>combination of flight instruction, corporate fill-in, and working at the local<br>Target store (remember what I said about the market when you graduate).  In 1994<br>I got a job as a FO at a startup charter & management company.  I was the second<br>employee flying a Sabreliner 40.  Over the next four years we added a Westwind<br>(which was later sold), a King Air 200, and a Gulfstream II.  I flew as a<br>captain on both the Sabre & WWII.  Last July, I left to take a position as a FO<br>with American Trans Air (ATA).  I'm now flying as FO on an L-1011.<br><br>I can honestly say that I didn't appreciate much of what I got out of Purdue<br>until the past couple of years.  When things are slow in aviation, it doesn't<br>much matter what school you've been to or what you've done.  What a good school<br>will do is give you the knowledge to succeed once you do get hired.<br>Additionally, a well respected school will get the attention of the person<br>reading the resume when things improve.<br><br>One or two additional thoughts -<br>You didn't mention what your specific area of interest in aviation is- airline,<br>corporate, ect.  What options you choose could be guided by your area of<br>interest.  EG- I planned on flying corporate.  My A&P was extremely helpful in<br>getting my last job.  If you are interested in management, structure your<br>education towards that.<br><br>Also, I strongly advocate attending a school which is known outside of<br>aviation.  If you can't find work in aviation due to the economy, losing a<br>medical, priorities in life chage (it happens) - you will probably find that a<br>degree from a well accredited school will open more doors than one from an<br>aviation only school.  Perhaps even better would be to get a degree in another<br>area entirely (aside from flying that is) and get the flight training on the<br>side or as a minor.  It really depends on what other areas interest you, but I<br>can't overemphasize having another skill to back up flying.  I know of several<br>people who have four year degrees in aviation who are working in fields other<br>than aviation.<br><br>Sorry this has run so long, but I hope it helps.  My closing disclaimer on all<br>of the above is that I've been very lucky to be where I am now.  I've been at<br>the right place at the right time which is invaluable, but I'd also like to<br>belive that I've had the necessary skills and knowledge when opportunities<br>presented themselves.  Much of that knowledge I acquired while at Purdue.<br>Dealer prep charges, tax and title not included, your milage may vary, not<br>applicable where prohibited by law, always see a trained professional before<br>starting any weight loss program, look both ways before crossing.<br><br>Feel free to E-mail me if I can mislead you further . . .   ;-)<br><br>

0	Just my opinion.	I think it can prepare you somewhat.  I never went from sims to real but i went<br>the other way.  I drove a mini-sprint of my friends several times (when he was<br>sick or unable to race) and was pretty good at it.  I was able to make the main<br>a few times and once managed a top five finish.  This experiance i think helps<br>me in GPL especially because trying to controll a powerful car on dirt is alot<br>harder than pavement.  Now im not the best at GPL, ill admit that, but i was<br>able to go fast sooner than if i had no experiance at all.  <br><br>Now the way i see it, if real world racing helped me in the virtual world, then<br>it should work the other way.  Being a good sim racer will never fully prepare<br>you for driving a real car...but it will definately help.<br><br>The part i find that alot of people dont understand in sims is setups.  This,<br>in my opinion, is the most realistic part of them.  GPL is a prime example<br>because the setups are more complicated than N1, N2, or ICR2.  <br><br>Just my opinion.<br><br>Chris<br>

The AT rises to a<br>> peak and then drops to near zero torque once the tire is at peak lateral<br>> force.

0	Keep at it<br>and work those setups.	I saw James Gardner on Speedvision and he was narrating a sport car racing<br>serial in the 1969-70 era and they had a crude in-car camera.  They<br>basically were crashing every lap if you know what I mean.  To drive<br>anything fast in that period seemed to be on the very, very ragged edge.  I<br>have so many hours in GPL at each track that I have learn to just float the<br>car.  I worked the setup to get what I want and my lap replays are faster<br>than the Pappy boys and way smoother.  No doubt, I am busy with the steering<br>wheel, but I drive the car like I would in real life.  The Speedvision show<br>I saw confirmed that GPL and real life are fairly close in some respects but<br>in order to be total "real life" the sim needs to "slow down" a tad.  The<br>other problem is that we are missing the seat of the pants feel for the car.<br>In computer life, we react visually, and that is what give us the ragged<br>edge driving sensation in GPL.  In others words, by driving visually, we are<br>tad behind the eight ball.  In real life, our butts are the best processor<br>God gave us for as countering g forces in the seating position. Keep at it<br>and work those setups. A good driving wheel helps too.  I have an ECCI CDS2R<br>system modified to be similar to the CDS 4000.  I don't know how anyone can<br>drive GPL with a Thrustmaster product.  Your seating ergonomics is very<br>important too.

Certainly the modern monocoque would have greater torsional rigidity than<br>the 67 cars, and the use of the engine as a stressed member is way more<br>advanced (I think in 67 this had begun?).

1	One last point, having another CFI's viewpoint on training is beneficial.	Today, I flew solo.  I was ready last month, but lost my instructor (he<br>moved) before weather conditions would cooperate.  Tried a different<br>instructor at the same school, but wasn't comfortable with him.  And this<br>leads to why I am writing this post . . . .<br><br>Don't be afraid to change CFI's or flight schools if you feel uncomfortable.<br>I live in Dallas and was originally flying at Addison Airport, which is an<br>extremely busy single runway airport.  On weekends, 20 minute waiting times<br>to take-off are the norm, as well as looong extended downwinds.  And the<br>nearest touch & go airport (Frisco, uncontrolled) often has 4-5 airplanes in<br>the pattern.  Anyway, I quickly discovered that I was losing about 40% of my<br>Hobbs time doing things that were not productive.  Although training at a<br>busy airport can be good experience, I quickly felt the added cost was<br>difficult to justify.  Also, during my training there, I witnessed 2<br>potential mid-air collisions (both involved airplanes crossing final<br>approach @ 500 AGL while other planes were landing) and a crash at Frisco (I<br>was # 2 to land when it happened . . . and that's an e-mail for another<br>day).<br><br>So after my instructor told me he was leaving, I drove out to several nearby<br>airports & visited their flight schools.  I finally picked Red Bird Airport.<br>I liked that fact that it was relatively uncrowded, allowed touch & go's,<br>and has 2 runways (35-17, 31-31) which is a plus for crosswind conditions.<br>In a nutshell, I felt safer there.<br><br>My transition w/ my new instructor was quick, just 2.4 hours dual before he<br>gave me the okay.  He even went up to the control tower to monitor my flight<br>& to let the controllers know it was my 1st solo.  Although I had been<br>nervous before the flight -- I even missed my exit while driving to the<br>airport -- I was calm once I did a couple of touch & go's w/ the instructor.<br>My solo was relatively uneventful & I was pleased w/ my 3 landings.<br><br>One last point, having another CFI's viewpoint on training is beneficial.<br>All three taught me techniques or preferences which the others had not.<br><br>Ecstatically Yours,<br>Ken<br>18.7 TT, 0.4 Solo!<br><br>P.S.  Please don't take this as a knock on Addison Airport, it is a fine<br>airport and the flight schools there are very good.  It just wasn't a fit<br>for me.<br><br><br>

For a go-around, you need to be careful not to remove too<br>> much flap all at once, but with a TnG, you are on the ground, and the flaps<br>> can be raised quickly one-shot.

1	> In the middle is the optimum power setting.	Power is used to counteract drag.  As the chart shows that<br>the total drag curve is U shaped.  The slow side of the "U"<br>is called the area of reverse command or as some people put<br>it, the back side of the power curve.<br><br>What is "reversed" here is that it takes MORE power to maintain<br>level flight at a SLOWER airspeed.  On the normal side, MORE<br>POWER (as Tim Allen would say) means more speed.<br><br>The reason this is important is that you only have a finite<br>amount of power available.  As you get higher up on that<br>slow side of the power curve, you may find that you no longer<br>have enough power to maintain flight at that speed.  The<br>recovery is a bit counter intuitive.  You have to lower the<br>nose and speed up.<br><br>> In the middle is the optimum power setting.<br><br>Depends on how you define optimum.

Lets start with the crap.  I'm talking NASCAR Revoloution.  I have just<br>proudly uninstalled NASCAR Revolution Demo from my computer.  If the<br>game plays better than the demo I have to say to EA "If its in the game,<br>why ain't it in the demo?".  Only 1 true good area on NASCAR<br>Revoloution, the graphics.  There are minor glitches in graphics but<br>otherwise they look great.  The minor flaws in graphics, crash damage<br>looks awful, cars look too rounded at the bottom, and a few other minor<br>things.  But, then there is the controlls.  In opinion very arcade<br>like.  No front tire squeeling due to turning to much and the car can't<br>handle it, able to turn at high speeds after starting a corner.  Car<br>turns rather well, not that it is rather real, on flat areas.  Easily<br>able to cream the road courses' record times probably.  Anouncers are<br>annoying (luckly in full game you should beable to turn them off). Car<br>gets 90% to fliping over, with plenty of momentum left and than flips<br>back on to wheels, little dammage done.  and when the car does roll it<br>always lands on its wheels and thers absoulty no damage on the roof, not<br>even a scratch.  EA, step away from NASCAR and get back to what your<br>good at (Hockey, Baseball, Golf, Football(of all sorts), Soccer, ect.).<br>Final verdict: "Yo, EA,  Looks ain't everything a game needs."<br><br>What I'm very impressed with tho is SBK.  What a sweet game.  This is<br>the true competitor to Castrol-Honda and it has already beaten it in my<br>mind, 1 month before release.  But watch out, Makers of CHSBK (Castrol<br>Honda SuperBike Champions) are back with SBK2, which supposedly have<br>full right to the SBK name, tracks, drivers, bikes and more.  And<br>possiably based on the '99 season.  Any way back to EA's SBK.  Some<br>people say that they wouldn't get this game due to it's demo in arcade<br>mode.  I think this is just a sign of whats coming.  They will add in<br>all the little things like loosing the bike easier and more<br>realisticly.  Just wait for the full and get it, even if you get it<br>warez sytle, its only in arcade mode right now, but I assure you Ill pay<br>the cash.  Love the turning, very realistic to my mind (and it is only<br>arcade mode right now).  Graphics look astounding.  Perfect job with the<br>shadows.  Menu Screen setup is great, (forgot to say but I dont like<br>NASCAR Revolution's Menus, sounds are crap, looks ugly, ect.) easy to<br>move through and looks nice.  Love the little things, shaking your fist<br>at drivers who hit you, and you (the player)<br>doesn't have to do any thing for that to happen.  Nice crashes.  All I<br>have to say is good things about this game.  If i had to complain about<br>this thing is that the gravel traps are very unrealistic to ride<br>through.  Just work on that bit and all would be great and maybe a few<br>other minor things, like add announcers (for people who like that<br>thing), make sure season runs properly (2 25-lap races per round.  both<br>worth points.).  Also sweet intro video placed with the demo, hope<br>that's used with the full game(maybe even a bit longer).  Final<br>verdict: "Look for me in stores the first day this hits the shelves."<br><br>Thats all I've gotta say.  I could care less about what you think of SBK<br>cause I know its the bomb, but If youve got any comments you wish to<br>tell me about either game send them in to my e-mail, djfil@idmail.com<br><br> DjFIL<br> http://members.xoom.com/DjFIL/<br><br>PS: Sorry about crappy spelling.<br><br>

ICR2 and GP2 didn't provide for<br>it, but others have. F1RS would have, but licensing issues prevented it.<br><br>>I wonder if the time is finally ripe for online racing to<br>>become more dominant an issue with sim makers, and with us!<br><br>This has been discussed before here at r.a.s. I certainly hope that all sim<br>developers make online racing a priority. I personally will have little<br>interest in any racing sim that doesn't have online play.<br><br>>Right now we use<br>>ras as our 'Gotham City' of simracing interest, ...but I see in GPL the<br>seed<br>>of a new 'city' based around online racing. In this sense we are still in<br>the<br>>stoneage of development  ..lots of strangers milling around, looking for<br>some<br>>action :-) Even in the next year, I think we'll see big changes in this<br>area.<br>>Online must be the final frontier?<br><br><br>The seed was planted long ago actually. N2 has a very large online community<br>although it's a differnet setup and you have to pay to play. The first<br>racing game I played online was POD by Ubi Soft. Not great performance<br>compared to today, but it was impressive (and fun) at the time (year and a<br>half ago). MS released CPR a year ago and that was the first sim to provide<br>convenient, free, online TCP/IP racing. MTM2 was released 6 months later and<br>the quality improved. There has been a very large online racing community<br>for the MTM titles for almost 2 years. MCM was the latest racing game<br>released by MS and also has online racing. MS has made internet racing a top<br>priority in their racing software, and the Zone makes it convenient to find<br>and set up races.<br><br>Ubi Soft would have had online play with F1RS, but like I said, licensing<br>issues prevented it. Soon, MGP will have online play with a game service.<br>I'm sure they will be drawing on their experience with POD.<br><br>To be honest, I really don't think TOO many conclusions about sims can be<br>drawn from what you read on r.a.s. It's such a small sample. A sim can sell<br>a half million copies, but the same 200 names appear here at r.a.s. month<br>after month. It's surprising how many familiar names I see when doing<br>anything sim related, online. Even in beta testing, most of the names have<br>been familiar.<br><br>One thing that's kind of interesting for me is that I see some of the same<br>hardcore online sim racers while moving form one sim to another. There are a<br>number of guys that raced CPR who are now in GPL. I looked at the qualifying<br>results for Zandvoort at Randy Magruder's league web page and the top two<br>guys (Art and Sandman) were also the top racers in CPR. There were a few<br>others from CPR there too. Art is someone who I also remember from POD.<br>Actually, if I were asked who I thought were the best online sim drivers,<br>I'd pick Sandman and Art.<br><br>What I've always felt is that online racing and internet play go perfectly<br>together. After all, real car racing is all about going head to head with a<br>human competitor on the track. One thing you can see on r.a.s. with regards<br>to GPL and online play is that there are some people who are experiencing<br>online racing for the first time and really enjoying it. When MGP releases<br>their online service, you'll see more of the same. Once people try online<br>racing, it quickly becomes addicting.  :-) So while the seed was planted<br>awhile back, I do agree with you that it will grow quickly form here on out.<br><br>David G Fisher<br><br><br><br><br>

0	Not trying to sound like a commercial for Codemasters or CMR, but if you<br>enjoy driving a racing sim, more than playing armchair mechanic/engineer<br>like many sims require, but want more than just an arcade racer like NFSIII,<br>then you'll love this game!	Mail ordered it from www.interactcd.com in California last Friday, and it<br>arrived in the mail on Tuesday via $3 priority mail....<br><br>Installed it last night, and as you might expect I  didn't get much sleep<br>once I started playing it :-)<br><br>What an awesome sim/game! Loads of fun, reminds me of ToCA in the woods on<br>speed! Has better graphics, physics and tweakable settings for the cars<br>unlike the rather arcade flavor of ToCA or games like NFSIII where you have<br>no car setup at all! It also has real car damage which you have to repair<br>between stages, but your only given a limited amount of time to work on the<br>car if you damage it, so you have to be selective about what you want to fix<br>or tweak (assuming there is no damage, but you just want to improve<br>handling, etc...) I find this a rather challenging and authentic aspect of<br>the game, but not so annoying as to spend hours and hours changing intricate<br>care setups in order to shave off a second or less from a lap time (ala,<br>GPL, CPR, F1RS, etc...)<br><br>If your into Rally racing, and have been waiting for this one to come out in<br>the stores / retail here in the USA, DON'T!<br><br>Go out and order it on the web now! It cost $42.95 w/shipping, but ordering<br>over the phone or over the net means NO TAXES, so the shipping cost offsets<br>the regular retail cost.<br><br>Before I ordered it, I called around to places like Babages, CompUSA, Best<br>Buy, Microcenter, etc... and no place here in Dallas had even heard of it,<br>much less had it on their list of upcoming software titles! They didn't even<br>have any news on the Playstation version (which I would assume will hit the<br>USA market first!)<br><br>Not trying to sound like a commercial for Codemasters or CMR, but if you<br>enjoy driving a racing sim, more than playing armchair mechanic/engineer<br>like many sims require, but want more than just an arcade racer like NFSIII,<br>then you'll love this game!<br><br>Cheers!<br>Jay J<br><br><br><br>

1	This will be an<br>exciting rush.	Hi David,  I have 30 hours and I think I might be soloing this Saturday.  Right<br>at this moment I feel a little gittery but  I can't wait.  This will be an<br>exciting rush.  I hope I am calm and alert when my instructor gets out.  Its<br>been windy lately here in South Florida.  I've been handling headwinds up to 22<br>mph and some crosswinds up tp 15mph with gusts up to 22mph.  Lately it is the<br>take offs that have me concerned.  A lot of turbulence with the winds and I<br>until I get some altitude and good airspeed I hate the thought of engine out<br>and not enough of either to get back to the runway.  Miramar has no land left<br>around the airport to land.. It is all homes, 1000' TV towers and narrow<br>streets.  Sometimes I think I MUST BE CRAZY, WHY AM I DOING THIS?  But I feel I<br>am past the point of return. I can't quit after all this time, study and<br>expense, besides it is a life long dream. Any way congrats to you.  Good luck<br>toward your checkride.

1	It's possible that a pilot unfamiliar with the aircraft may see one <br>phenomena (say an aerodynamic "block"), and think that it was due to another <br>effect (say the trim).	In article <19981002193927.15496.00001006@ng63.aol.com>, Mackfly wrote:<br><br>> Dave ole boy--ya need to do some more reading.  And you are wrong.  With "up"<br>> trim one needs more force to move the controls to the down position.  With<br>> enough up trim to stall the plane it would take even more force to move the<br>> controls to a nose down position.  In some planes this force may become more<br>> than a human can muster.<br><br>I don't buy this.  I have had a runaway electric trim in a C310, and that's <br>pretty darn heavy on the elevators.  I'm no muscleman, but I could hold it OK (at <br>least till I found the breaker)  That was at cruise speed.  In a spin, the <br>airspeed is a lot slower, and the trimtab correspondingly weaker.  ISTM that it <br>would be an exceptional GA aircraft where trim could not be overpowered (or an <br>exceptionally weak pilot!).  If you are talking about big aircraft after an <br>hydraulic failure, that's a fish of a different kettle :-)<br><br>> Then, not all planes trim with a tab on the elevators<br>> T.E.  Some move the horz.Stabs. L.E. up or down to control pitch trim.<br><br>True, I'd forgotten about this type of trim.  In this case, it at least makes <br>aerodynamic sense that the trim could affect maximum "down" elevator authority.  <br>It still doesn't ring true to me that it would be rigged so as to have a travel <br>great enough to prevent a spin recovery - I would have thought that this would <br>prevent certification, but I'm open to correction.  I would imagine that if so, <br>it would be very clearly stated in the POH, and probably placarded as well.<br><br>>      One or our main flying mags., only a few months ago, ran a story on this<br>> very condition during a pilot report on an aircraft.  Only when the pilot<br>> removed the nose up trim was he able to recover from the spin.  And, he<br>> mentioned that he had seen the warning before flying the plane.  but had<br>> forgotten to check it.<br>>      Now should I run into this mag. again, I'll give you it's name, date, and<br>> page number too.<br><br>Yes, I would like to see this article.  As long as it's not the same mag. that <br>ran the "downwind turn" story a while back :-)  Do you recall what type of <br>aircraft and trim system it was?  Or whether it was a certificated or <br>experimental aircraft?<br><br>Some aircraft exhibit unusual control forces in a spin, that can give the wrong <br>feedback to the pilot.  My aircraft has a strong sideways stick force (that can <br>result in the pilot not centreing the ailerons properly), and also has an <br>interesting aerodynamic "block" on the elevators as you push forwards to break <br>the stall.  It feels as if you have come up against the forward stop, but by <br>pushing a bit harder, you get quite a bit more travel.  It is mentioned in the <br>POH.  The spin will not recover unless you push through this "block" - but you <br>*must* wait for the spin to stop before applying forward stick.  Applying down <br>elevator too early prevents recovery.  Unlike many GA trainers, where it seems <br>that the spin stops whatever order you do things (or if you do anything at all!), <br>some aircraft need to be recovered by applying the standard technique *exactly* <br>as stated.  It's possible that a pilot unfamiliar with the aircraft may see one <br>phenomena (say an aerodynamic "block"), and think that it was due to another <br>effect (say the trim).<br><br>>      Also, I still have not seen any reason posted for doing stalls with use of<br>> "trim only".

I kept my eyes open<br>for traffic, but it just seemed like I should be saying something, but using<br>the same call that I would be using to back taxi for takeoff didn't seem<br>right. Maybe "back taxiing to exit" or something? Probably not really<br>important, but I like to be as thorough as possible.<br><br>Mike Regish<br>http://members.tripod.com/~mike534<br><br><br>

1	Then she was gone.....Man, how<br>big that 152 looked inside with her gone!!	At 24.5 hrs dual, I soloed at Allaire Airport, Belmar NJ.  I knew the<br>solo was coming because of the pre-solo written and the pre-solo<br>checkride (my school requires a checkride with a different CFI), I<br>just didn't know when. I arrived today for a typical lesson and my<br>CFI, Juliette Watt, asked me how I felt. I knew what she meant and<br>told her I feel just fine . She then said, " this is THE day"...... I<br>let that "sink in" for a while, took a deep breath, and  proceeded to<br>tune in AWOS and  heard a wonderful sound......winds at 8, 310 deg,<br>coming almost right smack down runway 32. Right away, I felt good.<br>Walking out of the FBO onto the field to pre-flight, I noticed how<br>blue the sky was and how beautiful it looked.....I always looked at<br>the sky before, but, today, for some reason, I really saw it for the<br>first time in quite a different way......Very soon I would be there,<br>alone, me in it, and it around me..................................<br>We departed the pattern for some steep turns and 360's for a little<br>warm up, went over emergency procedures and then Juliette said to head<br>back to do 2 touch and goes and then a full stop. I knew she was<br>expecting nice patterns and safe landings and thats what I tried to<br>do. All three were a little flat . I knew I could do<br>better......Pulling the plane off the active, she asked for my medical<br>and logbook and said, Are you ready? I told her I felt good, she<br>signed the papers, wished me luck, grabbed her flight bag and reached<br>for her handheld and advised me that she would be in radio contact<br>with me if the need presented itself. Then she was gone.....Man, how<br>big that 152 looked inside with her gone!! (quiet too, just kidding<br>Juliette).....I taxied to the hold-short, looked and listened for<br>traffic, (uncontrolled airport) , and then I said " Allaire traffic,<br>cessna 50 BRAVO is taking the active runway, 32, at allaire.<br>Yep, this was for real......power in full, rolling, airspeed active,<br>holding center line, ROTATE, and WHOOSH........UP UP UP..........The<br>plane feels so light and fast.......at 700ft where I usually start a<br>crosswind., I realize if I turn now I will be way to<br>tight......Extending the runway heading a bit does the trick......Im<br>back at my usual visual cues and feel good......downwind I stay at<br>1000ft and start picturing the landing....Wait......don't get too far<br>ahead......You still have alot of things to do.....I take a deep<br>breath......ok......Im abeam the numbers, power back, carb heat, wait<br>for the white arc, 10 deg flaps, its all coming together, left base ,<br>20 deg , a little high, power adjustment. ok....final 30 deg, I'm<br>looking good.......numbers locked in position and getting bigger.<br>Runway is made, idle power, rounding out, and flying over the runway<br>nice and level....When will I stop?.....I check to see if I pulled all<br>the power then realize the plane is much lighter now, ( a little<br>lighter, Juliette)........patience.....patience....patience.......I<br>land slightly flat but decent......Cessna 50 BRAVO is on the go for #<br>2 circuit..........on final I decide to go around as a landed plane is<br>procrastinating  on the runway for unknown reasons and I bank to the<br>right of the active when I see the plane on the runway start to take<br>off......Oh man....this isn't good......I know he doesn't see<br>me......maybe NORDO.....found out later that he was a student doing<br>t+g's and didn't announce his intentions........I tell him he has<br>traffic, ME, at his 3 oclock...he acknowledges. I get back to flying<br>the plane and he disappears at my 6......Next landing is more relaxing<br>and less flat.....Third circuit is gonna be my best..........Final<br>approach, round out........flying over the runway.....hold it...hold<br>it.........flare...................stall warning buzzer starts a<br>little chirp.......mains down........back pressure..........nose<br>gently falls.......a greaser........Did I just do this?  ( I'm smiling<br>right now just thinking about it)...............<br>Now, I just about ready to start learning how to fly and look forward<br>to reading the posts here that have helped me greatly  to reach this<br>point.............Thanks to all who post , for it is up to you, the<br>Student Pilot as well as the 747 Pilot who continually masters his<br>skills, to ensure that exchanging information and ideas with one<br>another will give birth to the next generation of aviators who will<br>look to us for guidance..............<br>Thanks..........<br>Mike.......24.5 dual_.6 PIC<br>

Recognize that this is about 20 yrs old...<br>><br>>My son is in the Cub Scouts and we are about to build a Pinebox Derby<br>>car for an upcoming race.  For those of you that don't know, Pinebox<br>>Derby cars are little cars carved out of a block of wood that race by<br>>coasting down a ramp.  We must design and build the car ourselves and I<br>>was wondering if any of you had any advice on making the car fast.<br>><br>There is a magazine that the Scouts get, (Boys Life???) and in the<br>back you can find a couple people who are "specialists" in the pine<br>wood derby cars.  They will provide to you (for a price, silly) some<br>NICE equipment help to give you a Penske unfair advantage.<br>Specifically, they have a "how to" book that details it all out.  They<br>also have microscopically turned axles with lubrication groves cut<br>into them to replace the 'nails' found in the kits.  They have some<br>microscopically turned wheels with trued centers to replace the molded<br>+/- .125: units found in the kits <grin>.<br><br>Trickiest, were the wheels that were trued, and lathe cut so that they<br>ran on a very tiny ridge to eliminate most rolling<br>resistance....<grin><br><br>GET THIS STUFF!<br><br>>Things I do know:<br>><br>>You should add lead weights to get the car up to the maximum weight (5<br>>oz. I think).<br>><br>MUST be at 5 oz...build it slightly over and using the "official<br>scales"  at the race dig out enough lead to pass tech.  I drilled a<br>hole, melted some sheet lead, and poured it in.<br><br>>You can use a dry lubricant on the axles.<br>><br>Molibdium Disulfide (Moly) is best.  Be generous.  And<br>repeat...repeat.......till the missus get's mad about the spots in the<br>uniform.<br><br>>Questions:<br>><br>>Does the car need to be balanced in any particular fashion? That is,<br>>should the weight be distributed evenly around the midpoint or set to<br>>the front, etc.?<br>><br>Technically, the further the 'weight' falls, the more gravity will<br>work on the model.  However, from experience, the typical cub scout<br>'track' is a little rough.  A car we built had a problem of popping a<br>wheelie and jumping the track when it hit a crack since the weight was<br>all in the back.  I'd recommend centering the mass between the axles.<br><br>>Any special aerodynamic considerations as to the shape of the car?<br>><br>naw.....wedge is easy to cut....  DON'T narrow the width at the axle<br>area.<br><br>>Anything else?<br>><br>yeah....  my experience says that getting the axles 'straight' is a<br>key.  The kit manual says to "bend" them to make the car roll<br>straight.  Horse pucky...you don't see Roger Penske bending HIS axles<br>with a sledge hammer.  Make sure you put them in straight to start.  I<br>did this by -<br>1)  getting some brass tubing with an ID that fits the OD of the axles<br>= easy to get at the hobby store.<br>2)  Using a miter saw to perfectly cut  grooves into the body, across<br>the body at a 90 degree angle and to equal depth for the axles.<br>3)  Set the brass tubing in the slot and glue and fill.<br>4)  File off the ends of the brass tubing flush with the body.<br>5)  Using epoxy, glue the special axles into the brass tubes.<br><br>Also, we found that the cars actually gain speed with "running in".<br>So, go find a nice 'test track' and allow the car to make several<br>passes.  Re-Lube, and repeat.  Make sure that the car is running<br>straight.  Adjust if necessary, and relube...  Keep it up.<br><br>During ALL of this, it's best NOT to let the cub scout touch the darn<br>thing.  They have a habit of racing them across the floor and seeing<br>what other toys they can crash into.  Doing so will bend the axles out<br>of alignment -- guaranteed.  If you drop it, you've got to start over.<br><br>Oh....let the cub scout choose it's shape - it won't matter - and let<br>him add any driver or other add ons like exhaust pipes, flames, and<br>stickers to his heart content.  Most dads think that they KNOW<br>something about painting and finishing so they put their time and<br>energy into that - and it shows.<br><br>However, Jr Roger Penske that YOU are, you can be sneaky.  Put YOUR<br>effort into making it run, and let the cub scout make it look as ugly<br>as possible <grin>....  victory is all the sweeter that way.<br><br>Dick<br><br>PS  Don't forget to put plenty of lube between the wheels and the body<br>where they rub......<br><br>

All<br>Some related information:<br>Hypoxia<br><br>An adult will breath in 3,000 gallons (by volume) of air per day. <br>This includes 600 (20% of total) gallons of oxygen. Your blood<br>system has 25+ trillion (12 zeros) red blood cells (hemoglobin). <br>Each one is capable of loading up four oxygen molecules for<br>distribution throughout the body. when returning to the lungs for <br>a refill they unload CO2 first.<br><br>Hypoxia is oxygen starvation. Lack of oxygen impairs the whole <br>body but most importantly the brain. The first part of the body<br>to show significant effect from oxygen deficiency is the retina <br>of the eye. Every individual is affected but in different ways <br>and to different degrees. The danger in hypoxia is that it occurs <br>insidiously below the conscious threshold. Hypoxia makes you happy<br>and such happiness in the cockpit is very dangerous. The best <br>warning indicator for hypoxia is the altimeter. You will quickly<br>recover by descent to a lower altitude.<br><br>Since hypoxia is due to reduced barometric pressure, low-grade <br>hypoxia begins on takeoff. The percentage of oxygen is same<br>but less is reaching the blood stream. Any stress or increase <br>in activity requires more oxygen, up to 8 times more. Pilot<br>performance deterioration begins at takeoff, as well. Slowed <br>response times and inability to deal with complexities due to<br>hypoxia compromise safety. Noticeable oxygen deficiency effects <br>begins at 4000 safety margins are beginning to erode.<br>Hypoxic symptoms of difficulty breathing or headache may not be <br>obvious or may not occur at all even though there are the<br>foregoing changes in mental status.<br><br>I have seen complete personality changes occur after a couple of <br>hours around 12,000. Symptoms such as headache,<br>drowsiness, dizziness, euphoria, tingling, perspiration, or <br>belligerence are typical. Tunnel vision and blue fingernails occurs <br>with times as little as 15 minutes above 15,000. At 16,000 <br>disorientation, lapses of judgment, loss of impulse control, risk-taking<br>behavior, decreased problem solving abilities, impaired memory, <br>mood disturbances, and lowered coordination are common.<br>Unconsciousness occurs in 10 minutes at 20,000.<br><br>All effects are made worse and happen at lower altitudes with <br>fatigue, age, smoking, health habits, and drinking. Oxygen<br>recommended above 10,000 day and 5,000 night. If oxygen is <br>being used, the pilot must be knowledgeable about the operation<br>of the system and be able to recognize his and the systems <br>warnings of oxygen deficiency. FARs require oxygen if 1/2<br>hour above 12,500, crew above 14,000, everybody above 15,000.<br><br>Gene<br><br>I have observed a total personality change in students at altitude.<br> <br>

0	If the car had a mechanical DNF, I added the total<br>number of laps in the race.	<br>In helping me decide about which car to use in an off-line series, I did<br>some research a while back as to the reliability of the various cars<br>from the actual 1967 season. Here are my results ....<br><br>First I looked at the percentage of laps completed.  To calculate this I<br>added the number of laps each car actually completed to get the<br>numerator.  The divisor is a little more complicated.  If the car was<br>still running at the end, I just added the number of laps completed. <br>Similarly, if the car was in an accident, I just added the number of<br>laps completed.  If the car had a mechanical DNF, I added the total<br>number of laps in the race.  There are some minor flaws in this - you<br>can get a 100% reliability rating if you crash out early; problems that<br>cause the car to dramatically slow, but still allow the car to finish,<br>are not reflected, etc.  Here are my findings for this approach:<br><br>1) Ferrari 95.7%<br>2) Brabham 89.7%<br>3) Honda 80.2%<br>4) Cooper 68.8%<br>5) Lotus 68.1%<br>6) BRM 64.5%<br>7) Eagle 36.4%<br><br>Second, I looked at the percentage of DNFs.  If a car crashed out, I did<br>not count it at all for the race.  So this calculation is the number of<br>times the cars was running at the end divided by the number of starts<br>for the car minus the number of times the car DNF'ed due to an accident<br>(not a mechanical failure).  <br><br>1) Ferrari 85.7%<br>2) Brabham 81.8%<br>3) Cooper 58.5%<br>4) Honda 55.6%<br>5) BRM 41.9%<br>6) Lotus 40.9%<br>7) Eagle 18.8%<br><br>No matter how you look at it, Ferrari and Brabham were by far the most<br>reliable cars and the Eagle was down right pitiful.  As bad as the Lotus<br>looks in these figures, it was actually even worse because a few times<br>Clark was leading only to have a non-fatal malfunction that cost him the<br>lead, but didn't cause a complete DNF.<br><br>I hope someone finds this interesting and/or useful.<br><br>Dave Ewing<br>

I do not<br>believe he got the new version, due to the fact that he got it from the Pits<br>site.  On to my problem!  I read that I needed WinSock 2.2 and downloaded<br>the ver. checker to find out I only had 1.1. Downloaded WinSock 2.2 and<br>installed it. I did not restart the computer because GSB was still<br>downloading.  When GSB finished, I installed it then restarted my computer.<br>When my system was back up, I connected to the Net and then started GSB.<br>First problem I got was a, "File Not Found" error.  What file? The other<br>problem, may or may not be a problem. I closed GSB, to see if it just needed<br>to be restarted, and another ver. of GSB running / or the first did not<br>close, it just minimized. I open it up, and that one won't shut down.  I<br>have to do a Ctrl-Alt-Del to actual end the task.  Any ideas?  I read<br>earlier, that the patch fixed the file not found problem. Is this the old<br>version, and there was only a patch?

0	Even adding some feel to them via<br>heavier springs, rubber hoses, etc., can't get around the lack of travel and<br>poor position.	Hi,<br><br>Just thought I'd share my opinions on my Logitech Formula (non-force<br>feedback) wheel and pedal set I just got. I agonized over getting the force<br>feed back model, but since GPL is the only driving sim I like, and I've<br>heard some less-than-glowing reports on the state of FF at this time, I went<br>with the plain model. Plus I plan on modifying the hell out of it, and it<br>will likely be easier without the FF complications.<br><br>First, why I bought the Logitech: the wheel. The wheel itself is just about<br>perfect, and better for driving sims than fancy Momos with buttons grafted<br>on them, IMHO. The shift paddles are large and well place, it has 4<br>perfectly located buttons, and the wheel itself feels great - perfect<br>thickness and nice  contouring.<br><br>I have been using a TM GP1 for about 4 months of heavy GPL use. I had<br>modified it for 270 degree rotation, removed the centering bungie entirely,<br>and made new clamps so I could still use my keyboard tray. The GP1, while a<br>bit cheap feeling and wobbly, works surprisingly well. The analog hand<br>clutch is excellent, and the thumb shift buttons, while not as nice as shift<br>paddles, work well. I had mated it to a pair of CH non-Pro pedals, with a<br>slit tennis ball strategically taped under the brake pedal, and they also<br>work quite well. The 270 degree rotation eventually fatigued all the wires<br>in the curly cord, and I thought shift paddles and some glance buttons on<br>the wheel would be nice.<br><br>The Logitech pedals aren't quite as bad as I thought they'd be, but they are<br>close. The travel is too short, they have little feel, and the position is<br>too vertical. The only thing that makes them useable is the adjustable<br>sensitivity in the Logitech control panel. Even adding some feel to them via<br>heavier springs, rubber hoses, etc., can't get around the lack of travel and<br>poor position. I am going to splice in my CH pedals until I build some<br>better ones.<br><br>I am also going to increase the rotation of the Logitech to 270 degrees, and<br>lighten the centering (I hope, haven't actually seen how that works yet).<br>GPL needs the precision that the increased rotation provides, or at least I<br>do when driving it! I also hate fighting heavy centering for lap after lap<br>of road courses in GPL. I also hope to build a better base for the wheel,<br>with some real ball bearings to get rid of the slop in the steering wheel<br>shaft, and a clamp design that will work with a keyboard tray. Where do<br>these guys think your keyboard goes to?<br><br>The Logitech wheel is lovely, and I got onto the shift paddles in about two<br>laps. A split paddle on the left with an analog hand clutch would be<br>perfect, but I can live with an on/off clutch button since the GPL clutch<br>basically works that way in any case. The stock condition wheel feels more<br>precise while driving GPL, than the GP1. Even unmodified, it is a pretty<br>decent wheel. Too bad about those pedals...<br><br>Kevin Caldwell<br>Calgary, Canada<br><br><br>

At the very least you could<br>keep your card and put in a V2 card.  My personal recommendation is to<br>buy a good 2D/3D D3D  AGP card and put a V2 card next to it.  That is<br>what I did, I play a lot of 3dfx (or GLide) games.  If you plan on<br>upgrading to a Celery the new board you get will almost certainly have<br>an AGP slot anyway.  Heck you can one of the new TNT cards for $160 (I<br>think) and V2 cards are coming way down in price.  The V2 card scales<br>very nicely with PII processors anyway, so until games increase<br>dramatically thier fill rate requirements, a V2 card will go along way<br>in your new system.  A good 2D/3D card in combo with a V2 card will<br>give you complete compbatility with all games with up to date<br>performance.

Since<br>you plan on OC your Celery, the more heat yo can radiate off the<br>processor the better off you are going to be.  OC creates even more<br>heat than normal in the processor, and if you can keep it cool, the<br>more chance you will have at a stable overclocked system.   Make sure<br>you have a good strong power supply however,.  the more fans you run<br>the more power you suck up.

You won't see the starting lights if the<br>trackside object have been turned off. Press ALT-D to see the starting<br>lights. <br><br>o Adelaide Invisible Pit Wall <br><br>When you are coming to the pits at Adelaide and you turn in the hairpin<br>too tightly you'll hit an invisible pit wall. This a way to prevent<br>taking short cuts. <br><br>o Missing Wet Weather <br><br>Grand Prix 2 does not contain wet weather or any weather variation. <br><br>o Missing 3D Graphics Support <br><br>Grand Prix 2 does not support 3D graphics cards. <br><br>o Missing Network Support <br><br>Grand Prix 2 supports modem and serial link play, but it does not<br>support network play, e.g. IPX protocol. <br><br>o Track Pack <br><br>Track pack is a commercial add-on disc by Instant Access. You'll have to<br>buy it from your local shop to get it. If you want to know what it looks<br>like, you download a demo version from the software page. From their<br>website you'll get a bug fix patch for their editor. More info at<br>information page. <br><br>General Game Playing <br><br>o Car in Pits <br><br>If you drive without steering help you can steer in the pit where you<br>want, but if you drive with steering help your driving is restricted.<br>Computer doesn't brake automatically. In pits there is 80km/h speed<br>limit. <br><br>o Controlling the Car <br><br>Pushing too hard on the throttle when coming out of a low-speed corner<br>will result in a 180-degree spin. If you lock up the brakes, clouds of<br>smoke can be seen in the rear mirrors and the car begins to slide in the<br>direction you are facing. You won't be able to control the car until you<br>release the brakes. Hit the curbs too hard at high speeds and your car<br>becomes airborne. <br><br>o Stuck in Sand <br><br>You can get out of the sand traps, but you will lose time because the<br>wheels are spinning causing your car to slowly leave the trap. <br><br>o Selecting Tyres <br><br>You can't select tyre compounds (A,B,C,D) yourself. As in the real '94<br>season Goodyear makes a choice of tyre compounds and brings only 1 type<br>to each circuit. <br><br>There are 7 sets of tyres, and the 3 numbers above are how many laps you<br>have done on each set of practice/qualifying tyres. The r1,r2,r3,r4 are<br>typically reserved for the race. <br><br>o Basic Car Setup <br><br>The basic thing in the car setup is that you put lots of wings to front<br>and less to rear. Gear rations depends much there are slow corners and<br>long straights. <br><br>o Car Slower in Race than in Practise <br><br>GP2 varies the car HP and Grip settings to better simulate real F1<br>racing conditions. <br><br>o Making a Good Start <br><br>The trick is to have just the right amount of revs as the light goes<br>green, then accelerate very gently. More info available how to use the<br>clutch at Tips and Tricks page. <br><br>o Braking and Wheel Locking <br><br>If you are using keyboard its very hard, the best way is to tap the 'Z'<br>key in quick short bursts. With pedals the best way is to brake hard at<br>first then gently ease of the brakes as the car slows. <br><br>o Running of Out Fuel <br><br>Altering the quickrace length can affect GP2's fuel calculation, make<br>sure your setup has automatic pit stops enabled. You may also need to<br>drive smoother and conserve fuel. <br><br>The fuel consumption data has been saved to the track .DAT files and<br>they can be changed with a track editor. Download it from the software<br>page. <br><br>o Extracting Setups from Hotlaps <br><br>Load the hotlap into the Performance Analyser, then exit back to the car<br>setups screen, the setup should have changed to the one in the hotlap. <br><br>o Saving Lap Records <br><br>GP2 only saves race records on 100% distance, but check out the software<br>page to find an util to fix this problem. <br><br>o Capturing Screens <br><br>The easiest program to capture screens is PCXDUMP. If you have problems<br>using this util, check also Universal VESA Driver. This util helps you<br>with problems with SVGA. (Check out the Software page to find those<br>utils.) <br><br>To capture the backgrounds without the menus go to the Advanced options<br>menu, and set the menu delay time to 2.0 secs. <br><br>Game Performance <br><br>o How Fast Computer I Need <br><br>You need at least 486DX 100MHz to play Grand Prix 2. 120MHz Pentium is<br>recommended. The faster computer you have the nicer the game will run.<br>However it has been reported that Pentium 200MHz is not enough fast to<br>run the game in full details. Maybe Pentium 400MHz is enough fast. (?) <br><br>o VGA or SVGA <br><br>If you have 486 - Pentium 133Mhz choose VGA or if you have Pentium<br>120Mhz or faster choose SVGA. Of course the menus will shown in<br>SVGA-mode although you have chosen VGA in race. <br><br>If your display driver does not support SVGA (requires 512kb video<br>memory) you'll have to start the game in VGA mode: start the game as gp2<br>video:vga. The menus will be shown now in resolution 640*480*16 and the<br>race 320*200*256. <br><br>Using VGA mode will damage your monitor, because it'll change the<br>resolution between the menus and the race. If you feel that your monitor<br>will break up and it's highly recommended that you'll play the game in<br>SVGA resolution! <br><br>o Texture Settings <br><br>There are two choices: Get a real driving experience with low graphics<br>or enjoy the beatiful panoram with high graphics. You'll have to make<br>that choice your self! But if you want to make a new lap record, frame<br>rate must 25fps and prosessor occupancy about 60-80%. <br><br>o S3 Accelerator <br><br>This program speeds up transfer rates from video cards with a S3<br>processor. That means that it will make the game faster if you have S3<br>video card!!! However, use the util at your own risk! Visit the software<br>page to download the util. <br><br>o Pentium Pro Accelerator <br><br>16-bit programs does not run very well with Pentium Pro. Because GP2 is<br>a DOS game, you will loose some horse powers. There's a util called<br>FastVid. It should increase the performance. Note! You must load<br>Universal VESA Driver before using this util. If you have the old<br>450-series mother board this util will increase the performance a lot!<br>Visit the software page to download the util. <br><br>o Universal VESA Driver <br><br>If you have problems with SVGA or taking screen shots, this util will<br>fix your problems. This util will also make the game faster! Visit the<br>software page to download the util. <br><br>o No CDROM <br><br>Yes! It possible to play the game without CDROM in the drive! Visit the<br>software page to download the NOCDROM util. You don't need to use FakeCD<br>or other corresponding util. <br><br>The TRACKDAT.BIN -file (215Mb) on the CDROM is just a fake and it has no<br>purpose, except to impede making illegal copies. <br><br>o AMD Processors <br><br>There are no problems running GP2 with AMD processors. GP2 runs amazing<br>good with AMD K6 200-233Mhz. <br><br>o Cyrix Processors <br><br>There might be some problems running GP2 with Cyrix Processors. Take a<br>look at Cyrix's home page to find an util to increase performance. <br><br>Editing the Game <br><br>o Using ZIP Files <br><br>If you are using Windows, download WinZIP. It's a very easy program to<br>use. <br><br>If you are still using DOS, download PKZIP 2.04g. Here are some examples<br>to use the util. More info can be founded in the documentation. <br><br>PKUNZIP -D ZIPFILE.ZIP C:\PLAAH Uncompress ZIPFILE.ZIP to C:\PLAAH<br>directory. PKZIP MYFILE.ZIP *.* Compress all files to MYZIP.ZIP file. <br><br>o Using GP2JAM <br><br>You'll need Trevor Kellaway's GP2JAM utility or a JAM manager. Browse<br>through software page to find a suitable util. Unzip GP2JAM.ZIP to<br>GP2\GAMEJAMS directory. <br><br>Command line options are: GP2JAM [-bFILENAME.BMP] [-jFILENAME.JAM] <br><br>For example to convert a JAM file to BMP file type: GP2JAM<br>-jC:\GP2\GAMEJAMS\WILLIAMS.JAM To convert a BMP file back to JAM file<br>type: GP2JAM -bWILLIAMS.BMP -jC:\GP2\GAMEJAMS\WILLIAMS.JAM <br><br>Notice! To convert a BMP file to JAM file, the JAM file must already<br>exist and it will be overriden. So, you'll have to know what JAM file<br>will updated! <br><br>You can convert JAM files easier by using Steven Young's GP2edit<br>Windows-editor. <br><br>o Painting Cars <br><br>Probably the editor to paint cars is Paint Shop Pro. It's a shareware<br>program, but it's a very good one! <br><br>The best way to learn to paint is to try make changes to the bitmap and<br>then look what it'll look like in GP2. <br><br>o Painting Helmets <br><br>Probably the editor to paint helmets is Paint Shop Pro. It's a shareware<br>program, but it's a very good one! <br><br>The helmet files are in the HELMETS1.JAM file. The best way to learn to<br>paint is to try make changes to the bitmap and then look what it'll look<br>like in GP2. <br><br>o Painting Cockpits <br><br>Probably the editor to paint cockpits is Paint Shop Pro. It's a<br>shareware program, but it's a very good one! <br><br>The best way to learn to paint is to try make changes to the bitmap and<br>then look what it'll look like in GP2. Don't make any changes to the<br>palette! <br><br>o Editing and Installing CPD Cockpits <br><br>To install and edit CPD cockpit files, you'll the Cockpit Designer<br>Editor. Go to software page to download it. <br><br>o Editing Menu Pictures <br><br>To extract and insert menu pictures, you'll the GP2 Hi-Pic util. Go to<br>software page to download it. Type GP2HIPIC /? to get more info how to<br>use it. <br><br>o Editing Sounds <br><br>You'll need WAV Extractor/Inserter by Maraich Giorgio. You can extract<br>the sounds of GP2 from the SAMPLE.CAT file and the convert them to WAV<br>files. Now you can listen to and edit the sounds. The edited sounds can<br>be insert back to SAMPLE.CAT. The sound format is 8-bit 22050Hz mono.<br>Some edited sounds can be found on software page. <br><br>You can change sounds easier by using Steven Young's GP2edit<br>Windows-editor. After listening all the sounds from SAMPLE.CAT you'll<br>notice that it includes sounds which the game does not use e.g. "Car<br>damaged!" "Well done!". These sounds are not used because the game<br>wasn't completely finished when it was released. <br><br>o Editing Tracks <br><br>There is a track editor available for GP2. Go to software page to<br>download it. <br><br>To edit and/or play the new tracks, you must have the NoCDROM, GP2NOCD<br>or Tracks on HD utility installed. Go to software page to download it. <br><br>The tracks are in the HD at GP2\CIRCUITS directory. The file names are<br>F1CT01.DAT - F1CT16.DAT. F1CT01.DAT = Brazil etc. <br><br>If you want to change the menu track names, you can change them with GP2<br>Track Manager or other corresponding util. <br><br>Trouble Shooting <br><br>o File Not Found Error Message <br><br>When you are starting a race in GP2 and you'll get a 'File Not Found'<br>error message as the program tries and reads the track off the CD.<br>Probably it will happen in all the circuits. The solution to your<br>problem is to : <br><br>    make a dir gp2\circuits<br>    cd\gp2<br>    md circuits<br><br>    copy files from your cdrom<br>    copy e:\gp2\circuits\*.dat<br><br>You do not need to copy that huge trackdat.bin 215MB file. Just the<br>track .dat's... then the game will work. This isn't a normal thing to<br>happen, check your CD-ROM it's most likely about to break. <br><br>o Game Settings Upside Down <br><br>Loading a hot lap will also load game settings from the hot lap, so<br>probably your game settings will go upside down. But every time you exit<br>from the game you will receive a question 'save changes?'. You should<br>answer 'no' and then your settings will remain as they was when you<br>started the game. Answering 'yes' will save the current changes. <br><br>o Windows 95 Problems <br><br>Because Grand Prix 2 was designed and developed to run under MS-DOS, you<br>may experience problems running under Windows 95. To achieve optimal<br>frame rate and performance levels, it is strongly recommended that you<br>reboot in MS-DOS mode. <br><br>It is important to ensure all necessary CDROM and sound card drivers are<br>loaded before attempting to run Grand Prix 2. Failure to do so may<br>result in the game not loading. (They have included the customer service<br>help documents in a directory called UTILS\HELPDOCS on the CD-ROM.) <br><br>AutoPlay: Some Windows 95 machines do not support AutoPlay. In this<br>case, please double-click on your CD-ROM icon and then double-click on<br>the install icon. <br><br>Windows 95 Keyboards: On certain video cards, Windows 95 is unable to<br>restore certain DOS- based graphical applications such as Grand Prix 2.<br>This is particularly a problem with the new Windows 95 keyboards<br>containing the new "Start" and "Windows" keys. If you press these keys,<br>Windows suspends Grand Prix 2 to bring up a menu but is then unable to<br>restore the game. The only solution to this problem is to run Grand Prix<br>2 in MS-DOS mode. <br><br>Microsoft Plus: To prevent problems running Grand Prix 2, the System<br>Agent should be disabled. <br><br>o Windows NT Problems <br><br>Grand Prix 2 will only run under Windows NT in VGA mode without sound.<br>However, the installation program does run under NT, because the<br>installation program uses straight hard disk writing which is not<br>allowed in NT. <br><br>o Installation Problems <br><br>If the installation program aborts or fails to copy any files, you may<br>have either a dirty or faulty CD-ROM. Please clean the CD-ROM disc and<br>try again. <br><br>Make sure you have enough memory before starting the installation as<br>outlined in the hardware detection phase. <br><br>Make sure that there are no viruses active and disable any virus<br>checkers. <br><br>Microsoft CD-ROM extensions (MSCDEX) should be reporting a version 2.23<br>or higher for Grand Prix 2 to work. <br><br>If you are still having problems, we recommend trying a boot disk. <br><br>o Sound Card Problems <br><br>If the auto-detect program locks up, reset the machine and try<br>reselecting auto-detect from the GP2 directory. If this again produces a<br>lockup or crash, try manually selecting your card's IRQ, DMA and Port<br>settings. If you are unsure as to what these settings are, try typing<br>"SET" from the command prompt or refer to your hardware manuals. <br><br>If you have a Sound Blaster card, make sure you have the necessary<br>device drivers loaded in your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.Bat files. It is<br>also important to have a SET line placed in the AUTOEXEC.BAT. <br><br>If you are experiencing problems with the program locking up or crashing<br>within the 3-D simulation, it could be because the auto-detect has<br>wrongly chosen your sound card. Run the sound setup program again by<br>typing "SETUP" and select "SoundBlaster (original)" or "No Sound." <br><br>Gravis UltraSound: The playback quality of the sound test sample may<br>sound garbled. This should not affect the playback quality during the<br>game. <br><br>ATI Stereo F/X: Grand Prix 2 is not compatible with this sound card. If<br>you have the ATI Stereo F/X, you need to select "No Sound." <br><br>Sound Galaxy Pro and Other Sound Blaster 16 Compatible Cards: The<br>auto-detect program sometimes wrongly identifies the Sound Galaxy Pro as<br>a Sound Blaster 16. You must manually select "SoundBlaster" and then<br>enter the correct Port, IRQ and DMA settings. <br><br>You can also start the game with no sound by typing the following<br>command line option: "GP2 Nosound." <br><br>o Modem/Serial Link Problems <br><br>In order to successfully connect Grand Prix 2 via modems, it is<br>necessary to know the correct modem initialization strings to turn error<br>correction and compression off. We have included some modem<br>initialization strings within the game, but these are not guaranteed to<br>work. Look for a newer list of modem strings at the end of this FAQ.<br>Symptons of incorrect strings are a slow frame rate and possibly a<br>lockup or crash. <br><br>Linking within Windows 95 can cause the system to momentarily pause. We<br>recommend running Grand Prix 2 in MS-DOS mode. <br><br>The highest baud rate can cause some systems to momentarily "hang" or<br>"freeze." Try selecting a lower baud rate such as 19200. <br><br>While linked, the background music will automatically be turned off. <br><br>You may find that you need to significantly reduce the detail level in<br>order for the game to run at an acceptable frame rate. This is because<br>the link takes up some processor power. <br><br>Grand Prix 2 has known problems detecting PCMCIA cards. Microprose<br>apologizes for any inconvenience. <br><br>COM Ports 3 and 4: During testing, Microprose found that some machines<br>(but not all) failed to recognize the presence of COM ports 3 and 4. To<br>help solve this, they included a small program called COMSETUP in the<br>UTILS\COMSETUP directory on the Grand Prix 2 CD-ROM. To run the program,<br>type "COMSETUP /H" at the DOS prompt. This will bring up a list of<br>available COM ports, their various port addresses and some help text.<br>You will need to find out what the hex address for COM ports 3 and 4<br>are. (This information can be obtained by running MSD or Windows 95.)<br>Once you have this info, you need to enter the values to the end of the<br>COMSETUP line and rerun Grand Prix 2. COM 4 may now be available. <br><br>Also make sure a mouse isn't plugged into the corresponding COM ports.<br>For example, if a mouse is plugged into COM 1, you will be unable to<br>select COM 3 (likewise for COM ports 2 and 4). If this is the case on<br>your system, try linking without a mouse or use the command line option:<br>"GP2 linkonmouseport." <br><br>If you don't know your modem's initstring, hangupstring and baudrate,<br>take a look at your modem's manual. If you have lost it try first:<br>   INITSTRING=ATZ<br>   HANGUPSTRING=ATH0<br>   BAUDRATE=19200<br><br>If you'll get data mismatch errors when linked, it usually occurs when<br>using modified GP2.EXE files that are different. <br><br>o GP2JAM And Windows 3.1x <br><br>If GP2JAM does not convert the BMP-files under Windows 3.1x, download<br>WINDPMI.386. Copy it to Windows\System directory. Add the following<br>lines to the SYSTEM.INI file, into the [386Enh] section:<br>   DEVICE=WINDPMI.386<br>   WinExclusive=0<br><br>o Matrox Mystique Problems <br><br>GP2 will crash if you are using old version of Matrox Mystique BIOS.<br>You'll get an updated version of the BIOS from Matrox's website. <br><br>Copyright Mindwork Net<br><br>=======================================================================<br>=======================================================================<br><br>http://www.internet.dk/hjemmesider/petetoft/gp2faq.txt<br><br>============================<br><br>        Grand Prix 2       <br><br> Frequently Asked Questions<br>                          <br>       July 24, 1996       <br>============================<br>Original Source Microprose's Web Site<br><br>Memory and System Requirements<br>==============================<br>Grand Prix 2 requires 8MB RAM (16MB RAM if running under Windows<br>95).

You can use these as examples to set up your own units.<br><br>The joystick port built into the Ensoniq Soundscape has a known<br>compatibility problem recognizing the GP500 race system (which may<br>affect other sticks).

You can edit the set name to say "T2" <br>or "TMaster" and then save the file.<br><br>Now calibrate the device, and your T2 should work.<br><br>Modem/Serial Link Problems<br>==========================<br>In order to successfully connect Grand Prix 2 via modems, it is<br>necessary to know the correct modem initialization strings to turn<br>error correction and compression off. We have included some modem<br>initialization strings within the game, but these are not guaranteed<br>to work. Look for a newer list of modem strings at the end of this FAQ.<br>Symptons of incorrect strings are a slow frame rate and possibly a<br>lockup or crash.<br><br>Linking within Windows 95 can cause the system to momentarily pause. We<br>recommend running Grand Prix 2 in MS-DOS mode.<br><br>The highest baud rate can cause some systems to momentarily "hang" or<br>"freeze." Try selecting a lower baud rate such as 19200.<br><br>While linked, the background music will automatically be turned off.<br><br>You may find that you need to significantly reduce the detail level in<br>order for the game to run at an acceptable frame rate. This is because<br>the link takes up some processor power.<br><br><br>COM Ports 3 and 4<br>-----------------<br>During testing, we found that some machines (but not all) failed to<br>recognize the presence of COM ports 3 and 4. To help solve this, we<br>included a small program called COMSETUP in the UTILS\COMSETUP<br>directory on the Grand Prix 2 CD-ROM. To run the program, type<br>"COMSETUP /H" at the DOS prompt. This will bring up a list of available<br>COM ports, their various port addresses and some help text. You will<br>need to find out what the hex address for COM ports 3 and 4 are. (This<br>information can be obtained by running MSD or Windows 95.) Once you<br>have this info, you need to enter the values to the end of the COMSETUP<br>line and rerun Grand Prix 2. COM 4 may now be available.<br><br>Also make sure a mouse isn't plugged into the corresponding COM ports.<br>For example, if a mouse is plugged into COM 1, you will be unable to<br>select COM 3 (likewise for COM ports 2 and 4). If this is the case on<br>your system, try linking without a mouse or use the command line<br>option: "GP2 linkonmouseport."<br><br>Grand Prix 2 has known problems detecting PCMCIA cards. We apologize<br>for any inconvenience.<br><br>Software Questions<br>------------------<br>There is no rain or different weather conditions.<br><br>It is not possible to control the car using a mouse.<br><br>Grand Prix 2 does not support the specific use of 3-D accelerator cards<br>such as the 3D Blaster from Creative Labs.<br><br>Grand Prix 2 does not support local area networks for head-to-head<br>play.<br><br>If the game displays the message "Can't start Grand Prix 2. F1system.dat<br>file damaged or not foundm," you need to either reinstall the game or<br>try running the game with the option "GP2 Nostateload." <br><br>If the game does not have enough extended memory to run, the SVGA<br>detail option will be greyed out. You need to free up more memory.<br><br>If the game cannot find a VESA driver, the game will run in 16 colors<br>and the SVGA option will be greyed out.

If your modem is not listed in this<br>list, please refer to your modem's manual and enter the appropriate<br>initialization strings. We suggest the factory defaults for your<br>modem.

By the way, I don't see force feedback pedals as<br>>an advantage, other than having a consistant pedal feel rather than a<br>>spring.<br>><br>><br>Why the chair has to rotate ? To have enough g to simulate a long and fast<br>corner, the chair has to rotate fast enough and quite a long time, it could<br>make one to feel sick rather than give a good cornering sensation. My<br>suggestion is a hydraulic chair/monitor combination cabaple of tilting to<br>both sides and to front and back. When the simulated car is taking a right<br>corner the chair tilts to the left.

I actually hope you guys can do just that, so I can<br>>drop my concerns and just enjoy it, as is.<br>><br>>I really want to love this sim but I have some serious concerns as to the<br>>accuracy of the handling of the cars. They just seem to be too wild. Even<br>>for '67 F1. It is certainly possible to adapt and put up fast times in GPL,<br>>but it's the way you have to drive the cars in order to get those times<br>that<br>>has me wondering.  If you look at the replays by the beta testers and the<br>>developers (including Kaemmer) which are included with the sim, the cars<br>are<br>>all over the track, criss-crossing the drive line (which is the fastest and<br>>smoothest line around the track) instead of holding close to it. I watched<br>>each one from the chase view. Then I checked the AI, and they straddle the<br>>drive line and stay very, very, smooth through a race or practice session.<br>I<br>>didn't see one replay where the testers were able to hold the drive line<br>for<br>>very long through a lap. Not even close actually. The AI cars seem to drive<br>>the way I'd expect the rest (or at least the more dedicated and talented)<br>of<br>>us should, yet even though the testers and developers have been racing this<br>>sim almost every day (I'm guessing) for maybe 5 months, they can't do it.<br>>Also, when I read the reports of the Papy Cup races, there is an awful lot<br>>of crashing going on and Alison said that when they would run a race with<br>>"shift-r" unavailable, it was not uncommon for no one (or few) to finish<br>the<br>>race. With all the experience those people have with the sim (and their<br>>talent), why aren't the races more realistic in their results? I just don't<br>>get the impression that anyone can run the same lap times as the AI, and do<br>>it with the same smoothness and control (holding the race line which is the<br>>fastest path around the track) that they do. Also, could anyone drive that<br>>way for a full race (or even 5 laps?).<br>><br>>If not, then why? Either the AI is wrong or there is something wrong with<br>>the drive model. They can't both be right or the most experienced drivers<br>>(like Kaemmer) would look close to the same way on the track as the AI. The<br>>cars react too much to the smallest steering input IMO. I've seen some film<br>>of cars from that era and they looked to be fairly smooth around the<br>course.<br>>Even in the rain (which IMO would be a mess to try to drive in with GPL).<br>>What I noticed about the real life drivers was that they really whipped the<br>>wheel around. Even in F1 today, real life drivers wrench that wheel quite a<br>>bit. In GPL, watch an in cab view of an available replay, or of yourself if<br>>your fairly good, and look at how little the steering wheel moves. People<br>>are driving by only moving the wheel a few degrees. There's about as much<br>>arm movement as an 80 year old Sunday driver needs to drive his Caddy on<br>the<br>>open highway. There's even less movement by the AI drivers. I think someone<br>>described the steering as "ultra power steering" in a post here at r.a.s.<br>It<br>>feels much too sensitive, especially compared to real life. The<br>>linear/non-linear slider isn't the answer. I've heard these '67 cars<br>>described as "overpowered, wooly handling, monsters" a million times. So<br>why<br>>is the steering SO delicate? Marc Collins has said that a speed sensitive<br>>slider would be best good for this sim and I strongly agree.<br>><br>>If you just step back and try to approach the sim with a fresh view (even<br>if<br>>you love it), and look at the way the cars handle, and how the steering<br>>responds to your input, something seems wrong. The way the best drivers'<br>>cars look as they do a competitive lap looks wrong, or at the least,<br>>considerably different from the AI. The results from races by people with<br>>months of practice time, and more talent than the average sim driver, are<br>>very surprising considering the amount of accidents that are still<br>>occurring.<br>><br>>David G Fisher<br>>DmndDave<br>><br>><br>><br>><br><br><br>

0	5.	I wasn't sure about the letterbox version at first , but I think it was a good<br>choice.  <br><br>I have a few comments about it below:<br><br>1.  This does inprove framerate as less screen has to be drawn.  GPL is very<br>CPU dependent game.  <br><br>2. Harder to see on 15" and below but great on my 17".<br><br>3.  Much easier to see around a corner with the wide screen format.  <br><br>4.  I didn't like the fisheye of CART and earlier indycar series.  I prefered<br>GP2's view to those earlier Papyrus sims.  Hopefully a future GP3 will have a<br>widescreen option.<br><br>5. This is just a great game.  No other sim has given me the satisfaction of a<br>great lap turned.  <br>6  The widesceen format allows the steering wheel to be shown fully and that<br>gives more driver feedback than most would think.  I think the wheel vibrates<br>as to the amount of grip and also helps you see how much lock your aplying.  <br><br>7. Best driving SIM to date period!!!<br><br>8.  How much for that SONY widescreen monitor?<br><br>In summary I give the widescreen a big thumbs up.  <br><br>Jerry<br>

Since aviation radios are<br>very expensive, it is the accepted practice to depower these items before<br>starting or stopping the engine.  Many training airplanes have had radio<br>master switches installed so you only have to turn off one switch to kill the<br>power to all the avionics.  If your airplane does not have a radio master,<br>you should use the on/off switch on each of the avionics items to turn them<br>off.<br><br>2)  I do not know of any modern VOR's that normally require a warm-up period.<br>Transponders do require a brief warm-up.  This is why they have a "stand-by"<br>switch setting.

0	.)	  OK John,<br>I was kinda snide about my first reply.  But here is what you asked for.<br>Most of this is on the technical side.  content choice and features<br>are developer design choices I guess.  But here are some important<br>items.<br><br>  1.  Get the Controller issue nailed down.  Thrustmaster dang near<br>invented the PC wheel market, but most of their older wheels are not<br>100% Win95/98 friendly.   also TEST TEST TEST as many different<br>wheels as possible.  Force Feedback etc.   This comes from<br>knowing your target audience.  You have 3 kinds I would think.   The Avg<br>computer user who barely knows how to turn it on, he probably has a gamepad<br>that came with the system.  Thats ok.   I would think the next level would<br>be the<br>semi serious users.   These are folks with some sort of wheel and a pretty<br>good knowledge on how to set them up.  The last group would be the ultra<br>serious users who spend thousands on wheels, soundcards, video cards etc.<br>   The single biggest mistake you can make is to shoot for the lowest common<br>denominator,  can put out "deer hunter" style mass market driving product,<br>but even<br>if you sell tons of them initially, your word of mouth reputation will be so<br>poor that any<br>other attempts at the genre will almost certainly be doomed.<br>  2.  The 2nd biggie is Don't promote and promise things the sim can't<br>deliver.  EA Sports<br>has a very bad reputation around here from the marketing of Nascar<br>Revolution.    If EA Sports<br>put out something that made GPL seem like a kids toy...they STILL wouldn't<br>get any respect.<br>kinda goes back to the first point.  If you do go low...say so..don't tell<br>folks your reaching for<br>the stars with a sim and then sell something that barely clears the weeds.<br>3.  For a sim to suceed is DOES NOT need multiplayer.  However...for a sim<br>to be well<br>recieved and to have repeat sales of a product line and good word of mouth<br>it MUST have<br>multiplayer capibilities.  The bar here is getting higher and higher.  If<br>you try and sell a product<br>that allows jerky head to head play without at least  the ability to add<br>many users...you are in<br>trouble.  Once again GPL sets a technical standard.   Even 8 player<br>capabilty would be acceptable<br>if DONE RIGHT.<br>4.  You do not have to ape every feature of physics that GPL has.  Creating<br>a sim that is "fun" while<br>also believable does not mean it absolutely must be on par with GPL.    Look<br>at new titles like<br>Toca 2 and SCGT.  Certainly not the struggle to drive as GPL is but fairly<br>well received.<br>5.  Notice I haven't compared anything to products like Need For Speed.<br>Once again, you<br>asked about a "simulation,"  If you really want to produce a Sim, strive for<br>that...NFS is great<br>fun but it most certainly is NOT a sim.    This ties in with the above, if<br>you want a NFS feel or<br>style, then you'd better let folks know early that ARCADE is the target, not<br>SIMULATION.  The<br>vocal few will crucify you and your sales will be stillborn.<br>5.  More hardware.  Video cards are rapidly advancing, so are soundcards.<br>Provide the resouces<br>to your developers so that the product is not only near the cutting edge,<br>but COMPATIBLE with<br>many different formats.  There are several key boards to shoot for....The<br>Nvidia line AND the 3dfx<br>line should be considered, and made rock solid BEFORE the product is<br>shipped.  3d sound<br>and the like are a rapidly growing area..get your Vortex2 and EAX issues<br>found, fixed and delivered<br>BEFORE you give a shipping greenlight.<br>  Any more questions?  :)<br>dave henrie<br>John Bodin wrote in message <36ff0251.15726543@news.iquest.net>...<br>>On 29 Mar 1999 00:35:36 GMT, schlomo4@aol.com (Schlomo4) wrote:<br>><br>>>I kinda agree with the other people that responded to this message even<br>though<br>>>i am a strong supporter of IRL.

1	The only thing that helps is to fly the X-C in my armchair<br>first and anticipate the ATC hand-offs along the way.	I think it's much more important to plan your workload properly on XCs,<br>because everything goes out of the window when you're too busy to keep that<br>heading or time that checkpoint.<br><br>I'm a student close to my checkride learning at a Class C airport (Oakland)<br>in very busy airspace (San Francisco Bay Area).  I'm as anal as the next<br>student pilot with my flight planning and cockpit organization, but I'm<br>most careful about organizing my workload because it's my biggest problem:<br>I stop following procedures/checklists/flight-plans and start reacting<br>instead of acting when I'm distracted or too busy.<br><br>A prime distraction for me is ATC, especially because I usually don't<br>factor it into my planning.  On the first few minutes of a X-C, I typically<br>talk to ATIS, Ground, Tower, Departure, Radio and Center.  Along the way, I<br>might dial in Flight Watch or various ASOSs, not to mention the half-dozen<br>VORs in my flight-plan.  If Bay Departure asks me to switch to Travis<br>Approach or calls traffic when I'm trying to compute my groundspeed, of<br>course I'm going to drop the E-6B and do the "Aviate, Navigate, Communicate"<br>thing.  By the time I've settled down again, I've lost a few precious<br>minutes and probably wandered off course or am almost on top of my next<br>checkpoint.  The only thing that helps is to fly the X-C in my armchair<br>first and anticipate the ATC hand-offs along the way.<br><br>Another thing that increases my workload is checkpoints that are too close<br>to each other.  I know some CFIs like to see checkpoints every 10nm, but<br>even with no ATC chatter these come up too fast for me (even in a C150 it<br>takes only 6-7 minutes to do 10nm).  I've found that checkpoints every 20<br>nm or so apart work best for me if I'm primarily using VORs for navigation.<br>The last checkpoint before my destination usually falls by the wayside as<br>I'm too busy talking to ATC or scanning for traffic or going through my<br>descent/pre-landing checklists to bother with the flight plan.<br><br>So do yourself a favour and plan to give yourself enough time.

I just read the most informative piece of material I have ever read.  <br>Columnist<br>David Lawrence Dewey's recent column, "Hydrogenated Oils-Silent Killers".  <br>It<br>is unbelievable how we have been poisoned for over 50 years by the food<br>industry, causing a 1200% in diabetes since 1920, a 53% increase in <br>coronary<br>heart disease, a 40% increase in breast cancer, other cancers, auto-<br>immune<br>diseases, attention deficit disorder in children, high cholesterol, the <br>list<br>goes on an on.  Mr. Dewey's column is very informative with research <br>links to<br>the medical studies from Harvard and other leading researchers.  These <br>oils are<br>in our foods.  Even the American Heart Association has recently issued a<br>warning to avoid hydrogenated oils.  You must read this to save yourself <br>and<br>others and possibly heal yourself.  Denmark is the only country that bans <br>these<br>oils since 1950, and they have the lowest deaths rates from any of these<br>diseases.  Mr. Dewey's site is http://www.dldewey.com.   I urge you to <br>read<br>this, it will save your life.  And no, this is not one of these new <br>things that<br>this or that causes cancer.  This is for real folks and the FDA has kept <br>this<br>truth from us.  I am a member of the League of Women's Voters and I <br>understand<br>they have refused to get this information our to our members.  I am <br>canceling<br>my membership, this is too important of information not to get out to as<br>manypeople as possible.

Wow!  I went back and read your original email, Stephen.  I missed the part<br>of your original posting where you stated that you were with the FAA.  I<br>don't remember what state you live in, but here in Florida impersonating a<br>law enforcement officer (which would fit the definition of FAA employees<br>authorized to pursue enforcement actions) is a felony.  I'll bet dollars to<br>donughts that there are Federal criminal statutes that you may have violated<br>as well.  I offer this unsolicited advice....you are walking on very, very,<br>very thin ice if you behave in this manner.    If the individual you acosted<br>had asked for your credentials (I don't think he would have been fooled by a<br>temporary PP certificate) he would have been 100% within his rights to call<br>your bluff, call 911, and demand your arrest.  Frankly, I would have done<br>exactly that.<br>To say that we are all a member of the FAA is ridiculous.  It would never<br>stand up in any court.  Think logically about it....I have a driver's<br>license issued by the Florida Department of Highway Safety but that hardly<br>makes me a state trooper, does it?  I also have a passport issued by the US<br>State Department but that hardly makes me Madeline Albright or an employee<br>of the US State Department.  If an FAA enforcement staffer read your email<br>(a very possible occurence) you have in essence confessed publically to what<br>could well be a criminal offense.  Remember Jack Kevorkian and his<br>videotape!<br>If you really think the situation warrants it, get the pilot's N number and<br>name (if possible) and report the details to the local FSDO.  But don't play<br>policeman yourself!<br>Finally, to change the subject slightly, what is the active runway at an<br>uncontrolled field?  ALL OF THEM!   For example, yesterday the wind here was<br>light and variable.  Airplanes were taking off and landing from 21, 27, 15,<br>and 9 all more or less at the same time.    Unnerving?  A bit, yes.

0	!, 34 seconds faster<br>than I had been.	Here are my observations of the differences between the beta, (v0.2.0.0), and<br>the final version (v1.0.0.0),  of GPL, some of which I understand, and some of<br>which I dont.<br><br>Okay, okay, first of all, yes I downloaded the early Warez version, while I<br>waited for the final version to appear here in the UK. I am not defending this<br>course of action, but now that Ive spent my £34.99 in Dixons, and deleted the<br>old version, my conscious is clear...!! (flame away lame burgers..........)<br><br>Let me tell you about the system Im using currently. I have a P200 pentium,<br>(actually a P133 with an overdrive chip), 4 meg video card and a 12 meg voodoo<br>2, and the frame rate is pretty poor at about 13-15 fps. I believe this to be<br>due in part to the inferior FPU, included in the overdrive chip from Evergreen,<br>believe me, Ive read every post about improving fps in r.a.s over the last few<br>weeks., and tried every tweak, and still no improvement. Not to worry, Im<br>investing in 450mhz PII in the next few weeks, so Ill soon be running at 36<br>fps, (you know it makes sense..!) I also have a Thrustmaster NASCAR Pro wheel<br>and peddles, and even though the TM gets plenty of bad press in r.a.s., Im not<br>a heavy user, and it seems to suit me fine, (I can feel the flames starting<br>already...)<br><br>Anyway regardless of the fps, I still find the game very playable, if a little<br>difficult to control. With the demo, and before any major tweaking, I was only<br>getting 10 fps on a good day, which made the Lotus at the Glen almost<br>impossible to control. At this point I decided to look for the warez version,<br>to see if there was any way I could make the game more playable by adjusting<br>the setups. (I would never had even considered the warez version, if it had not<br>been for the fuss it created in this newsgroup, so blame yourselves!). <br><br>Having found the beta version, (v0.2.0.0.), I proceeded to swap the Lotus for<br>the Ferrari, and spend my life at Monza, Spa and the Ring. After gradually<br>switching off more and more detail, (only the groove, horizon, wall textures<br>switched on, plus trees at Monza, you cant run at monza without the trees for<br>god sake), I finally arrived at my 12-15 fps average.(If you switch everything<br>off, not only does it only increase the fps by about 10%, or in my case 1 fps,<br>but it makes the game look strangely like Indy 500, and a bit like GP2!!)<br><br>Any after many many laps at the Ring, my best lap was still only 11:48.68,<br>which although nowhere near the 8:17 I was reading about at in r.a.s., I still<br>felt was pretty good considering the technical restrictions of my system. I<br>moved back to Monza, where after maybe 200 laps, I could still only just<br>scratch the edge of 1:37, even after going round the dial on setups. Even<br>though I was hopelessly un competitive, I just love throwing the Ferrari into<br>the Curva Grande, and struggling to fly through Ascari on full power. I also<br>spent an enormous amount of time at Spa, finally managing to nail down a 4:04<br>lap. I then setup a race, so that I could watch where Bandini and Amon were<br>changing gears and braking, and you could just imagine my horror to see Graham<br>Hill set a fastest lap of 3:30 after only the first lap..!!, 34 seconds faster<br>than I had been. This was a low point in my GPL career.<br><br>As I could not download any setups in the beta, and I did not have the great<br>"Four-Wheel-Drift" manual by Steve Smith, I was not sure whether it was my<br>skill level, my setups, the low fps, the TM wheel, or a combination of all of<br>these that was making me so much slower that everyone else in the world. Still,<br>I continued lapping at various circuits ands loving every minute of it.<br><br>Last Sunday I managed to pick up my copy of the final version of this great<br>game, and could not get back home quick enough. After installing, and spending<br>a great deal of time reading the "FWD" manual, I set up my wheel and peddles,<br>put on my driving socks, started my engine and headed straight to Monza, the<br>circuit I felt that I knew best. <br><br>The first thing I noticed was that my average fps had dropped to a consistent<br>12-13fps, with very little variation. This was quite noticeable when doing the<br>first few recon laps, as the game played a little jumpy, but perseverance is my<br>middle name and I continued for about 10 or so laps, before coming into the<br>pits to look at my setup. Imagine my surprise when I check my lap times to find<br>I had gone over 2 secs quicker on my 7th lap at Monza, than I had gone in the<br>previous 3 weeks with the beta..!!! Even though I did not feel that I was<br>driving as smoothly or fast, I seemed to have improved dramatically. Off to Spa<br>next, and the same again, within 2 laps I was 6 secs faster, even though I felt<br>more ragged!<br><br>I believe that the main reason for the improvement was down to the default car<br>having a much more competitive setup than either the demo or the beta version.<br>Well at least now I know that my previous attempts to set the car up had been<br>hopelessly wrong, and now that I had the "FDW" manual, I should be able to<br>tweak my setup to be better.<br><br>I then downloaded the Doug Amarno set ups from Alison Hines, "Eagle Woman"<br>site, and gave them a try. Both the Monza and Spa setups seemed to be very<br>skittish, and proved very squirrily under braking. Being a purist, Im not keen<br>on using other peoples setups, (sort of like cheating I think), and I like to<br>set cars up to suit my style of driving, (stiff, low and controllable). <br><br>So last night I returned to Spa, (what a track..!!), armed with the default<br>Ferrari setup and the manual, and set about setting the car up to my liking.<br>After many return trips to the pits, and some spectacular crashes into several<br>of the buildings along the back straight, I set the damage to realistic, and<br>went out for a full blown training session, in an attempt to bring my lap times<br>down. On lap 17, after an almost incident free lap of shortshifting and five<br>sixths power,  I managed a 3:45.38, which represents a massive 19 secs faster<br>that my previous best. I then watched Dougs 3:25 lap of Spa in the Lotus, and<br>saw several areas where I could improve my braking and gear changing, but by<br>this time it was midnight, and I did not want to annoy my wife any further than<br>I needed to.<br><br>Even though Im still significantly slower that the top AI drivers, I feel that<br>I know where the improvements to my setups and driving strategy can be made.<br>And when I get my P2 450, and 36fps, I believe that this will only help my<br>times.<br><br>Another change I have noticed is that the linearity slider seems to be much<br>more sensitive. When using the beta, I was setting the linearity under the "a"<br>of linear, which is where I set it when I first installed the final version.<br>This made the car impossible to drive, where only the slightest movement of the<br>wheel sends the car from one side of the track to the other, and made braking a<br>life and death decision. I have now set the linearity to about the middle of<br>the scale, which seems about right for the moment. Has anyone else noticed<br>this, or is it just me?, (unique or freak?). I will try moving closer to the<br>left hand end, once I get a little more competitive.<br><br>I also noticed that the TV1 & TV2 camera angles have changed from the beta to<br>the final, certainly at Spa, which I think is an improvement.<br><br>I really enjoy the driving experience of GPL, and even though not having the<br>fastest system in the known universe, with a little perseverance and<br>dedication, I am extracting as much enjoyment from the sim, more than equal to<br>the effort I am putting in to it. GPL is certainly the most realistic sim Ive<br>driven, (I was a heavy user of GP2, as a GP2 league driver), and Papy should be<br>congratulated on their major achievement.<br><br>Watch out my fellow GPL drivers, Im hoping to lock wheels with you very soon,<br>on a circuit somewhere......<br><br>SteveG<br><br><br><br><br><br>

Ask a question and get good help from real<br>pilots.<br><br>2)  Adventure files using the exceptionaly good "Cockpit Sound System",<br>featuring the voice of a Copilot for the checklists and the radio work (he<br>will<br>answer every message). If you have a failure he'll radio it in and leave you<br>to the<br>flying "Mayday, mayday, mayday - Sun Airlines 6LA we've lost our no. 1<br>engine, request immediate return". Soon the coding will have failures<br>randomised and ATC chatter and Center varied by region and country. The<br>adventures are constantly in developement and are already sounding very<br>atmospheric.<br><br>3)  Accurate routing. A text flightplan and a Real Weather flightplan<br>following<br>routes planned on aviation charts. Also as many .IAP's as we can muster.<br><br>4)  Diversions to an alternate field if the "Real Weather" closes in, or if<br>ATC<br>inform you that the field is closed.<br><br>5)  Failures and emergencies to test you're capabilities to the limit.<br>Imagine<br>visibility down to half a mile in heavy turbulance when you lose an engine<br>and<br>spot what could well be a fuel leek. It's time to earn your money. You will<br>have<br>to be clear on the proceedures as the flight you are just pulling off the<br>runway<br>could well be the one with an emergency lurking.....<br><br>6)  Practice emercency proceedures in the "Sun Simulator". A series of<br>adventure files to simulate the most common failures, and of course the<br>dreaded multiple failures.<br><br>7)  A fleet of aircraft (long and short haul) with flight models tested to<br>be as<br>accurate as is possible. Smooth sleek and sexy !<br><br>8)  Advice on realistic scenery and panels, supporting the concept of<br>freeware<br>as opposed to commercial products.<br><br>9)  Being new and in developement we will be looking for Hub Operation<br>Managers in the near future to cater for an impending expansion. That could<br>very easily be you !<br><br><br>So you've read all that and you're still flying for that old naf VA that jus<br>t gives<br>you a schedule and assignments and sod all else.

0	The<br>Hayshed is there an the pit lane looks pretty accurate.	Ther was a fun game about 8 years ago that had Phillip Island. Motorcycle Gp I<br>think it was called. You could race 125, 250 or 500cc. Team Suzuki also brough out<br>a game around the same time but I could never control the thing.<br><br>Since we have ahouse on Phillip Island and I attend just about every race meeting<br>there it was interesting to see how the graphics compared to the real thing. The<br>Hayshed is there an the pit lane looks pretty accurate. The only part of the track<br>not true to form is Siberia. Since this is where I spend many a cold day watching<br>bikes I feel a bit upset that the game shows no crowd here at all. Just trees that<br>don't exist.

Anyway, if you'rre turning<br>onto a right crosswind after takeoff I think it's fair to say that is with a<br>righthand banked turn that is probably combined with a climb. <br><br>Normally, in a properly rigged airplane, with a propeller that rotates to the<br>right when viewed from the cockpit, you'd have to apply a little RIGHT RUDDER<br>to compensate for the YAW FORCES being exerted on the airplane:  Spiraling<br>slipstream and p-factor.  TORQUE is a ROLL FORCE exerted on the airplane by the<br>engine.  The emphasis is so you'll recall the associations.<br><br>Either you are flying an airplane that is quite out of rig, or one whose<br>propeller rotates opposite the way it normally should, or the TSI is a bit out<br>of whack position/mounting, or you're holding some left aileron in for some<br>reason.  The left aileron application would mean that the right wing's aileron<br>is down to some degree.  The DOWN aileron would then PRODUCE AILERON DRAG, also<br>known as ADVERSE YAW (the result acutally).  The drag of that aileron would<br>want to yaw the airplane to the right. That would be reflected by a left<br>displacement of the inclinometer's ball (part of the TSI) to the left.  And<br>that would require you to apply the left rudder.  What you may be dois<br>sub-consiously cross-controlling the airplane for some reason. Ask your CFI to<br>check you one that.<br><br>Getting back to the possibility of mis-rigging, there are a number of<br>non-mechanical ways to check that out.  One is hands off cruise flight, trimmed<br>for a constant altitude, another is a full power off stall that's entered into<br>with wing's level.  Watch how it rolls when the stalls occurs.  May be a clue. <br>You could also check it in a power off glide (don't forget to clear the<br>engine!)  I"d ask your CFI to do these "tests" if I were you.<br><br>Other than the above, I cannot think of another reason the problem exists.

1	We flew to a towered<br>airport nearby (which I've only done once before) and I was doing the radio<br>calls.	Went up for an hour today. It was pretty windy, but it was right down the<br>runway so takeoffs and landings weren't too bad-well they wouldn't have been<br>were it not for all the chatter in my headphones. We flew to a towered<br>airport nearby (which I've only done once before) and I was doing the radio<br>calls. There was traffic in that air and all were talking. I was trying to<br>make radio calls announcing turns while my CFI was telling me what to say<br>word for word. I couldn't get a word in edgewise. I managed to make the<br>necessary calls after which my CFI would nitpick every little word while at<br>the same time the guy behind me is trying to communicate with me and the<br>tower was trying to communicate with me. We managed to get down and parked<br>without anybody running into anybody, but then when we flew back to home<br>base for a few TnG's, I finally had to call it quits because the CFI just<br>plain wouldn't be quiet. I didn't want to be rude and tell him to put a lid<br>on it, so I just stated firmly that this would be the last landing. I don't<br>know if he took the hint or what, but he was pretty much quiet for the last<br>landing and it was one of my best for the day.<br><br>I have to say I was really starting to lose patience with him today. I have<br>about 15 hours now and I can fly the plane. If I go 40 feet over or under<br>altitude while I'm trying to line up on downwind he say "watch your<br>altitude." While I'm trying to get my altitude *perfect*, I'll crowd the<br>runway. He points this out so I try to get *perfectly* aligned with the<br>runway and my airspeed goes up, which he immediately points out. I know it's<br>suppose dto all happen together. I was dealing with a LOT of turbulence and<br>quite a bit of traffic with its accompanying radio chatter. I think what's<br>happening is that he's noticing things at a different  time than I am and<br>while I'm correcting what I've noticed he catches something and I have to<br>concentrate on that, etc., etc. The windsock was straight out today and<br>there were some real good bumps. There was a lot of traffic and I wasn't<br>able to make any of my radio calls because the CFI was talking or somebody<br>else was making calls. Even though his hands aren't on the controls, he's<br>got to verbally correct every little move of the controls I make. I think if<br>we had worked on landings earlier in my training, I would have been soloing<br>already, but I'm in no real rush. I know he's getting close to being ready<br>to solo me since he's got me signing rental agreements and carrying my<br>logbook, etc., and I don't want to switch CFI's at this point. As sloppy as<br>my landings were today, he might be changing his mind about now.<br><br>Question #1) Is it ok to tell your CFI that you would like quiet in the<br>cockpit while you're landing? I know he has mountains more experience than<br>me, but I think at this point he should be observing what I do and seeing<br>how I evaluate and react to different conditions and circumstances. Instead,<br>I think he's still trying to control the plane verbally through me, which is<br>tantamount to flying it himself. IE., I don't get a lot out of it.<br><br>Question #2) When I am down near the runway and bleeding off airspeed, I use<br>little back and forth elevator control inputs in order to judge wether or<br>not I'm going slow enough to flare. When the plane stops tending to go up<br>when I pull back, and the contro; movements need to become larger and<br>larger, I start adding steady back pressure until I settle to the runway. My<br>CFI keeps telling me to "hold the controls in the landing attitude." This is<br>fine on an ideal approach in smooth/no wind with everything set to land, but<br>I can't get it to work when dealing with high winds and turbulence. I had a<br>couple of real hard landings trying to just "hold the controls" because I<br>was sinking too fast and wanted to pull back some more, but didn't. What are<br>some opinions as to bleeding off airspeed near the runway?<br><br><br>--<br>Mike Regish<br>http://members.tripod.com/~mike534<br><br><br>

Besides it was<br>originally designed to land on carriers... Not much trouble with crosswinds<br>when you hook the cable & stop in 2 seconds.<br><br>When we land on a runway, the technique is no different than landing on a<br>carrier, it is still an unflared landing with about 600 - 1000 ft-min rate<br>of descent.<br><br>The problem arises when crosswinds come into play. You cannot fly a wing low<br>approach into a crosswind. You have to fly crabbed into the wind, take out<br>HALF of the crab before landing and land with the other Half of the crab...<br><br>That part is not too bad either, it just feels kinda weird. The big one<br>though is AFTER touch down.<br><br>After touchdown, the aircraft is still in "Flying mode" (Let's call it that<br>to simplify things a little) which fades out slowly in about 5 seconds.<br><br>So, for the first 3 seconds, on the ground, you are just along for the ride<br>until you see the NWS (Nose Wheel Steering) light come on in the HUD. While<br>you are waiting for NWS to come on, the Upwind wing is getting picked up by<br>the crosswind & you can't do anything about it.<br><br>Once nosewheel steering comes on, you use rudders only to keep the A/C lined<br>up & you ignore that strange feeling of the upwind wing lifting up (Easier<br>to say than to actually do it BTW).<br><br>Also, the nose of the aircraft does not turn into the wind, it turns AWAY.<br>You correct with very slight opposite rudder (which make the plane feel like<br>it's really going to flip over. but you keep ignoring that fact & don't do<br>anything about it.

1	I<br>still keep my inhaler handy and I haven't gotten my medical yet, but I<br>really don't think it will be a problem.	I have mild asthma. I quit smoking a little over 4 years ago and within 2<br>months had my first asthma attack. I think mine is triggered by stress. It's<br>funny that I didn't need my inhaler at all in '97 until March of this year<br>when I had some problems with a real psycho that I work with. (Guess<br>what...I work in the post office.) Well, I got screwed by my employer and<br>the court system as well as having gotten maced by this guy just for the fun<br>of it. That triggered my asthma and I had been using my inhaler 2 to 5 times<br>a day since March. After my first hour lesson, I used the inhaler once and<br>haven't used it since. I find that focussing my attention on learning to fly<br>has taken my mind completely off my situation at work and I haven't had even<br>a hint of an attack. I was worried that the stress of learning to land might<br>trigger it, but that's a different kind of stress that I kind of like. I<br>still keep my inhaler handy and I haven't gotten my medical yet, but I<br>really don't think it will be a problem. My worst attacks are uncomfortable,<br>but not debilitating.

The problem is that depending on<br>where they enter down wind they could be any where within an area over three<br>miles long by close to a mile wide, but hopefully at the proper altitude.<br><br>I had one call cross wind and I called entering down wind and I fly a fairly<br>tight pattern.  Usually about a half to 3/4 mile out.  Cross wind... Was<br>that mid field, at the numbers, or where?  No answer. then I hear "turning<br>down wind".  I finally spotted him coming across the numbers in a steep turn<br>to parallel the runway about 300 yards out in a 172.  I anounce base and<br>just as I get ready to anounce turning to final he anounces base about 300<br>yards off the end of the runway.  By the angle in the windshield and the<br>spot not moving I can tell we are going to reach the same spot at the same<br>time which is just where he will be turning final.<br><br>I poured on the power and made an early left turn (no where else to go) out<br>of the pattern where I made a 360 and then rejoined down wind.<br><br>by the time I had landed the 172 had landed, coasted up to the gate, picked<br>up a passenger, and kept right on going back out to mid field, onto the<br>runway and departed. Note that was without a shutdown.<br><br>He was talking but certainly not listening.<br><br>> I was a bit worried that a turn was going to take me right<br>>into the other airplane. (In this case I called base, since I was<br>>near the end of the downwind leg by then). Should I have turned right,<br>>out of the pattern? Climbed? Descended?<br><br>I think you made the correct decision as when you are both down wind and you<br>don't know whether the other aircraft is in front, behind, above, or below<br>you the best thing is to give the path to the runway a careful examination.<br>Bank a bit to try and see above and below to make sure you are not landing<br>on, or being landed on.   As to turning right out of the pattern; The other<br>aircraft might be to your right and would not expect you to make a right<br>turn.<br><br>In a 150 I'd not think that there would be many instances where you would be<br>overtaking other aircraft, Certainly there are instances, but in the 172,<br>182, Cherokees, Archers, and Warriors there is the posibility of over taking<br>a slower aircraft and being overtaken by faster ones as well.<br><br>A number of times when the other aircraft would not respond I've resorted to<br>asking on Unicom, or the CTAF if anyone can spot the other aircraft and if<br>so where is he in ralation to me.<br><br>The unfortunate thing is that when other aircraft anounce that they are down<br>wind it only means that they are (most likely) *some where* on the down wind<br>side of the runway and a cross wind may be from most anywhere over the field<br>to as much as two miles off the out going end of the runway.  Base may be<br>from the numbers to as much as two or three miles out.<br><br>Idealy every one would anounce where they were, not just on down wind, base,<br>or final.

"Dry & Go"<br>> (product you spray on and around distributor cap) seems to work<br>> occasionaly, but what really works well is a hair dryer blowing air that<br>><br>> same area. Another problem I'm having  is while driving occasionaly the<br>> engine seems to start chugging, if I accelerate or slow down it<br>> eliminates the problem. Same thing happens if it's snowing out and snow<br>> gets to the distributor cap. Dealership say's all looks fine, but<br>> somehow it still fails.<br>><br>> Any suggestions? Could it be the condenser that needs changing, and if<br>> yes is it very difficult to do?<br>><br>> Thanks<br>><br>> Mike Morris<br>> mmorris@nrcan.gc.ca<br><br><br><br>

Before you go out and get those windows tinted,<br>be aware that Alberta's laws don't allow tinting<br>of the side windows in the front.  That said,<br>you will see vehicles with obviously<br>after-market tint jobs on all their windows all<br>over Calgary, Edmonton, Lethbridge, Medicine<br>Hat, and I'll bet in the rest of the province.<br>The problem is that this violation is not a high<br>priority to the enforcement folks, so unless<br>they are feeling nasty or are not too busy<br>(rare, I suspect, given the crime rate in the<br>cities), they won't likely stop you for that<br>alone.<br>Speaking of the Police, if you call them at<br>their non-emergency number and talk to them<br>about your problem, they may be able to increase<br>their patrols on your route at your travel time,<br>or offer suggestions on alternate routes or<br>something to avoid this harassment.  The Police<br>don't have much use for hotdoggers in Calgary,<br>and probably not elsewhere (they charge them<br>with "stunting", and the courts love to slap<br>those characters) so they are probably more than<br>willing to help as far as their resources go.<br>From another angle, if this harassment is<br>occurring in a city, and is during your travel<br>to and from your work after hours, your employer<br>is required BY LAW to ensure your safety; for<br>instance, the bank data centres will provide<br>taxis for their female employees whose shifts<br>end in the late evening and at night.  This<br>policy is not limited to Alberta, but is across<br>Canada.<br>I don't favour the bigger vehicle strategy, nor<br>is waving a baseball bat (or some similar<br>display of defense) a wise ploy.  The former is<br>giving in and losing your freedom of vehicle<br>choice (and increasing your driving costs) and<br>the latter can backfire if you encounter some<br>yahoo who decides to challenge you to see if you<br>can and will use your weapon.  In that case,<br>even if you are willing and able to use it, you<br>stand a good chance of getting hurt.<br>One last thing, since you carry a cell, make<br>sure it is programmed with a one-stroke 911 call<br>button.  If you are out there and someone really<br>has you afraid, a single keystroke will put you<br>on the 911 system.  Even if you can't talk, they<br>can locate you, since the active phone talks to<br>the base sites, and the 911 folks can use the<br>base site locations to pinpoint your position.<br>Again, there's nothing the blue-and-whites love<br>better than to nail someone in the act.<br>I know you have had lots of advice, so I suggest<br>you take whatever advice will work for you, even<br>if it's not mine ;)<br>Good luck!<br><br>B.L Templeton<br>Long-time Calgarian (Feel like a Native-Born)<br><br>

0	I can see it being put to good use in both.	Oh dont get me wrong, many games have alot FF efx in them. I just<br>listed the effect in each game that really stood out to me as 'cool'.<br>MS FlightSim98 has much more than just take off effect. And NFS3 has<br>alot more than just the 'sliding' effect.

My first inclination was to consider FF a gimmick <br>>aimed primarily at arcaders.  Me, I'm a flight and racing simmer (lately, just <br>>the latter).  I can see it being put to good use in both.  In flight sims, I'd <br>>like it to mimic the feel of a stick when one gets into buffeting and the <br>>mushiness associated with near-stall flight.  In racing sims, the obvious <br>>benefit would be in giving road feel to indicate slip.  My guess, and as your <br>>report tends to support, is that it is instead used for things like gun <br>>vibration and rumble strips.  To me, that isn't worth the change to FF.  And <br>>as noted by the GPL designers, they don't think FF is there yet for the road <br>>feel.  So, maybe in another year or so?  I'll wait.<br><br>

0	Almost never get<br>past 4 or 5 laps.	I posted this last week but got a weird mesage about "no such article in<br>group" Some people responded but they got the same message so here goes<br>again...<br>I have a problem with F1RS crashing intermittently. Sometimes at the<br>beginning of a race and sometimes after a lap or two. Almost never get<br>past 4 or 5 laps.  <br>My machine is a PII/300 with 64MB Ram, ATI Expert@play 8mb video card<br>and an Ensonique sound card. My joystick is a Gravis PC Pro. All drivers<br>are at latest levels. Have tried all suggestions in UBISOFT's FAQ sheet<br>as well as suggestions from the help desk.  <br>Does anyone out there have similar config and/or problems that may have<br>found a way around the crashes? When it crashes it takes me back to the<br>Win95 desktop. I like the game but it drives me nuts from all the<br>crashes. C'mon GP3!!!!<br>

0	My conclusion:<br>The choppiness in the pit lane is of little concern to me.	Well, I picked up GPL yesterday, but I didn't have a chance to install<br>it until this morning, about a half-hour before I had to go to work.<br><br>Here's my system:<br><br>K6-225<br>64Mb EDO RAM<br>12MB Orchid Righteous 2 (most recent 3dfx reference drivers)<br>CL SB AWE64<br>Thrustmaster GP1 steering wheel (set about 80% linear)<br><br>I installed it, fired it up and went straight for a single race at Monza<br>with a full field. I set graphics to 800x600, all textures on ahead, no<br>textures in mirrors, showing only cars and track in mirrors. I don't<br>remember if I set the objects to "many" or left it on "all". Left all<br>effects settings per default, except for sounds, which I bumped up to 5. <br><br>I didn't read any documentation, so I didn't know how to access<br>framerates, but here's my subjective impression:<br><br>In practice, coming out of the pits was choppy but not unmanageable.<br>Once I got to the first two cars in the pit lane, things smoothed out<br>(and this was with one car leading out ahead of me). I drove a few<br>practice laps, everything seemed pretty smooth, the car was very<br>responsive. My best lap was 1:35.xx (my best in the demo was 1:38.xx),<br>putting me 11th on the grid.<br><br>Going to the race, I didn't bother changing the default car setup, so I<br>think I had a full tank of fuel. On the start (man, it's hard to see the<br>man with the green flag), the framerate was choppy until about where the<br>track splits for the banking. Controls were still fairly responsive<br>though. I dropped about 5 positions on the start, but managed to hold my<br>own through the first turn, running alongside several cars in the back<br>half of the pack. Framerate was adequate, (not noticeably choppy, though<br>not entirely smooth) and the car responded quickly to my input. I didn't<br>notice any drop in framerate while passing cars. <br><br>I made up three or four positions on the first lap. On the second or<br>third lap, I overshot the Parabolica and ended up in the sandtrap. By<br>the time I got out of the trap, I was at the back of the pack, out of<br>sight of the cars ahead of me. I managed on the next two laps to catch<br>and pass about four or five cars. At the end of lap 5, I realised I<br>should probably get to work, so I retired and quit the game. I didn't<br>check to see what my best lap was, though I expect it was comparable to<br>my best practice lap.<br><br>My conclusion:<br>The choppiness in the pit lane is of little concern to me. I'll need to<br>try a few more starts, however (and get some pedals so I can use the<br>clutch) to find out if the low framerate keeps me from getting as good a<br>start as I need.<br><br>In the game, with 19 cars on the track, driving with groups of 5-6 cars<br>ahead and around me, the perceived framerate was quite adequate and, as<br>I said above, the car was very responsive to my input. I didn't feel as<br>though there was any lag.<br><br>So, since the HMRC league doesn't begin until December, I feel<br>comfortable that I don't need to upgrade my system quite yet to get a<br>few good practice races in before then. My wife will be happy to hear<br>that, as well.<br><br>Michael Knepher<br>
1	Any ideas?	What you describe seems to be a common problem. I have been flying for<br>years and still have a tendency to flare high if I have not made recent<br>night landings. The technique that works best for me is to not judge my<br>distance from the runway by what's nearest the airplane, but by looking<br>towards the far end of the runway. Try switching off your landing lights<br>for a few landings and just concentrate on the far end of the runway.
