0	2**32-1  thanks in advance.	      I am interested in the following topics.  1)BIOS programming on 286 and 386. 2)Memory management in 286 and 386. 3)Developing Visual Basic Custom Controls.       I would like to have your valuable opinion on the books that are best in the above topics.  Please send a mail to rmehta@paul.rutgers.edu . I will post a summary of the  suggestions.    2**32-1  thanks in advance.
1	I think Washburn has very competitive prices compared to other AMI distributers,plus I liked  the fact he's a EE that knows what he's talking about
concerning hardware, and he can be easily reached via CompuServe for non  
critcle questions, and is very informative to his customers over the phone.

have a PS font that you want to use, use ATM.	 There are some fonts that are only available as PS fonts.  If you have a PS font that you want to use, use ATM.  Otherwise, it is a waste of system resources.  Personally, I use both. 
1	And where can I get more info?	Is there a PC like that?? And where can I get more info? I know of the Atari portfolio but it can't stand the rain.... 
1	I can also tell you that I'm one of those who won't buy a UART made by
anyone other than National Semiconductor.	no argument on going direct to National (see my previous post on this topic), but some info regarding what you said above.  I don't know about the 8250 or 16450, but NS was the original source for the 16550 series (and I strongly suspect that they developed the others first, too).  I can also tell you that I'm one of those who won't buy a UART made by anyone other than National Semiconductor.     --jim  -- #include <std_disclaimer.h>                                 73 DE N5IAL (/4) ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ INTERNET: jim@n5ial.mythical.com  |  j.graham@ieee.org     ICBM: 30.23N 86.32W AMATEUR RADIO: n5ial@w4zbb (Ft.

The permenant swap file is read/written to by windows by talking directly to the hard disk controller card.  The controller card must use the protocal set up by western digital (or something like that). Windows creates a file called spart.par in your windows directory that points to that file.  It then uses the physical information about your disk to index to information in that file.  compressed disks are actually "logical" disks.  These disks have different characteristics than the actual physical disk.  Furthermore, the information on the compressed disks must be uncompressed before it is used.  (i.e it must go through the decompression program that traps disk reads at the operating system level or the BIOS level).  Because of this "inbetween" program, windows cannot use direct methods to read from the "logical" disk.  a permenant swap file is only there to "reserve" an area of the disk that windows can use and to block that space from DOS.  Windows would theoretically not even have to access the file from DOS to use that disk space. (I don't know if it does or doesn't...but it checks for it somewhere everytime you boot windows.)  a temporary swap file is just a normal DOS file that is accessed by windows via DOS and the BIOS.  If a disk compression program or other TSR is loaded the file access must go through DOS...TSR'S (disk compression)...and BIOS in order to be access. (i.e. NEVER USE A TEMPORARY SWAP FILE...NEVER)  more on permenent swap files...  i'm sure everyone who has an uncompressed part of their compressed hard disk has seen the message "you have selected a swap file greater than the suggested size...windows will only use the size suggested...do you wan't to create this swap file anyway" or something like that.  well, a friend of mine (ROBERT) called microsoft and asked them what and why. what they said is that windows checks the amount of free disk space and divides that number by 2.  Then it checks for the largest contiguous block of free disk space.  Windows then suggests the smaller of the two numbers.  They also said that under absolutely no circumstances...NONE!...will windows uses a swap file larger than the suggested size.  Well...that's what he  said!  I call bull@#$#.  If this is true why does windows report the memory is available to me if it's not going to use it?  any takers?  James

The size is just right for centered wallpaper on a 1024x768 display because it leaves a border at the bottom just big enough for icons to fit in without being on top of the picture. Reguarding image quality and resolution - I have not seen much better.  For those of you who haven't worked with pieced image files, here is how to put it back together. 	1. save the 14 parts to 14 individual files 	2. use a text editor to remove the header and footer 	   in each file. 	3. concatinate all the parts into a single file 	4. uudecode the file There are tools available to do this without the hassle such as uuconvert (UNIX) and UUcoder (Windows).  If neccesary I could post these tools or where to get them by FTP -- let me know. ------------ Part 1 of 14 ------------ begin 644 ROMAN.BMP M0DT:S0@``````!H#```,````P`-8`@$`"``H,%4L*%DX2%G*E95(4'U9:8&% M@?HT-%T,,$A`55U]?>K*=769QLY(1,Y9<77*RLJJUN(P/%UI@8D8&%E(3%D0 M/%VZNKI55?)U@<[*JJH42&U$55DH*'&RVOH857T0/&$X4%6-KL:JSOH@>;:) MB>HT/%D42'%=7<Y$1'V9F?_*B8DL,%D858&=KO^-MKH<89&5H?_*:6DDA<HL M,%W*OKX8584\2&%U<?I$0%DT-'$<896%H<X@;:7*G9V-I>)(684D>;8<89FA MI:65NM9QA;(@;:H\2&G*?7UYB<8D>;IYD;8T1%G&QL9E=94HA<H01&504(59 M5?\H)%W*LK*VMK9978E]A?I,55DHA<XP,&'&^OI$2%F)D?(44'G*D9%]F:%E M8?HP.%5(885,68FAMOIM>;+*<7'*QL:VXO\878V5G>Y`4%UA<84<:9TX1%T0 M.%EU?<K*I:441&D<::$84'E`/%D@(%T@=;(X,%E,887*A84D@<*)F?(84'V^ M]OHX3%5(76EU=>(@*%!I;;(D(%4@=;8<78W*966AQNK"PL(D@<;*NKJ1B?]] MH:5MA=XHC=8P0%D<79&RLK)5685]>?HL+%T@::$\/'&1D?+*F9F9LO^!E>I0 M4*6AH:$\,%EM:>J5KN)A8;I(4%D\1&6=LO;*>7EI=:ZZZOH,-%`X.%E$4&DT M-*&EOOH00&&=NNHLC=;*KJZZZO\43'&5I?I9686ESMZRYNX00&5$/&6JVNX4 M3'7*C8T<'%G2^O^!D<X8685$1%EIA9D43'DX0%7*;6W*PL*VWOH868E`3%F^ MOKX<99DT2%5M:?](2'U588U(65TP-%D@<:K*H:&!H;8\55FNKJY]?=HD?;H< M99TX0%V9I?^-KJZESNX@<:Y95=+*@8&1NKYM;<IA=7DD?;Y56:55896-KK(H MB<YUD9U077E096E$0*6RTOK*MK8X0&6^\OI(4'FJQOJ9QL8HB=*9D?](2/(` M``````````````````````````````````````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`=]W=0$E)W4!W=W>%W=UWW7=)=W=`=W=W M2>-`A4!)2>/C=W?CA>-)=^-)22-WXTE)XTGCXX6%0.-)0$!)X^-)X^/C2>/C MXTE[X^/CXTGCX^/C>^/CX^/CBDF*24E[BN/7XXKCBN.*BN/CX^-[XXKCXWLR MX^/CBHJ*,GOC>S).>^/C,HI.XS**,GN*3GN*BDXRBHI8,GN*6(I8BHJ*BC(R M6(J*>S**BDXRBHI.,O/S3DY.Y_-.BN=.,HJ*6//G\_.*,DY8YS)8Y_-8\TY.

1	don't encourage the third-party
development of drivers.	486-33 DX, 16 mb of ram on a Novell 3.11 network Monitor:  NEC 4FGe, capable of 76 Hz vertical refresh rate  Major considerations:  I expect I will work mostly in windows, but with some DOS applications and I would want decent speed in DOS.  I do mostly word processing, database and communications--not much intensive graphics.  With a 15" monitor, I expect I will work mostly in 800X600 and 256 colors seems plenty, but I'd like like the image to be sharp, fast, and rock solid.  Other considerations:  I sometimes run a Unix clone (Coherent) and I understand that some companies (e.g. Diamond?) don't encourage the third-party development of drivers.  I might move to OS/2 if I decide I need better speed and reliability than I get with Windows for my database work and multitasking.  I don't have a local bus motherboard--I'm not sure how much to invest in an ISA video board (versus getting something less expensive now and upgrading to local bus later).  I like buying things from companies that treat their customers well.  If you have any advice for me, I'd love to hear it via email or post.  Thanks.

His machine (a dx48633) has a 16550AFN UART, so that's 	not the problem.  	It seems to me that the stupid thing wants to talk to 	 	a comm program _at_ 14.400bps, even though it will take 	dialing instructions at 56k (and respond OK, etc. to  	other commands).

Also, it's _using_ V.42bis and V.42 (and MNP5) when connecting 	here (i.e., at 9600, since our tests at 14k4 are zip so far) 	but it doesn't _say_ so there.  any ideas?  	(BTW:  I tried the initialization string that I use for 	my modem, but it just gives ERROR on that one)

know if they still offer it or what the current price is, I paid 
something like $50-$60 for an upgrade from the earlier version though...

Hope this helps...

If you want to do SQL from within your programs, check out QuadBase.	On my own I was able to find out about Codebase, Accsys, and Q+E. Codebase and Accsys are C libraries without SQL. Q+E is a Windows application that can be communicated through Windows DDE calls, where you send a SQL string and receive the results.  Most people wrote to tell me about the Paradox Engine from Borland. Other  products mentioned were: Microsoft's ODBC, Accsys, Quadbase, Codebase, RBASE, and Q+E. Only ODBC, Quadbase, RBASE, and Q+E have SQL.  For myself, I decided on Codebase, mostly because it has an ANSI C portability version that runs under DOS, UNIX, etc, and includes the source code, and portability is important in my application. It works with DBASE, FoxPro, or Clipper files.  However, I feel that Microsoft's ODBC looks very promising. It's mostly a formalisation of building and submitting SQL queries, and formatting query results. As the responses say, it's available via ftp, except it's effectively unusuable without two manuals: the "ODBC Programmer's Reference" and the "ODBC SDK Guide". Moreover, ODBC doesn't actually interpret SQL and liase with databases, that's  up to drivers that should be provided by database manufacturers. Also, it's Windows only (it's actually an extension to the Windows SDK).  Nevertheless, it's a start at a SQL interface standard, and should make life interesting in the future.  Here's my original post, followed by the responses, separated by  a line of asterisks (*).   ****************************************************************************  Borland has a product called Paradox Engine that does just what you want.  The current version is 3.0, which is fully compatible with (ack) Paradox 4.0.  (Why the versions are different, I don't know. PD Engine 2.0 was compatible with Pdox 3.0 and 3.5...).  It consists of a rather broad library of functions for accesing database files from both Pascal (I think turbo Pascal 5.5 and up) and C (I think either Microsoft or Borland).  Now.. reading the box... it's "Borland Paradox Engine & Database Frameworks".  Works with any Borland C/C++, Mocrosoft C 6.01 or later, Turbo C++ for Windows, Turbo Pascal 6.0 or later, TP for Windows 1.0 or later.  For Framework applications, BC++ 3.0 or later or MS C/C++ 7.0. It does have support for object useage...  I haven't had a real chance to really use it myself... but it looks fairly complete... I'm planning to use it this summer. -Rick --  +--------------------------------------------------------------------------+ +--------------------------------------------------------------------------+  ****************************************************************************  Borland has a product which is called Paradox Engine.

Look at ftp.uu.net in vendor/microsoft/odbc-sdk.   Also some companies are starting to provide SQL engines; I  just got one for RBASE, not exactly cheap at $450, but it  allows programs in C or VBASIC (under DOS or Windows) to talk  to data bases using SQL functions in your code.   hth   Walter Knopf  Fermilab   knopf@fnal.fnal.gov   ****************************************************************************     Check out the ODBC toolikt from Microsoft.

Its hardly SQL though.  You can do searches on key fields and on  indivual fields, but no comparison operators like <, >=....  so its pretty painful (in my opinion) do do anything besides simple retrieval and inserts/updates.  I'm currently using it (I have an eval copy..) and I've linked it in to some entry screens I've written.  The Engine library adds about 100K to the size of the program, but you can load it as an overlay using Borland's VROOM manager.  Now Borland claims that later versions of the engine will have SQL support but they don't really expect it till late in the year... or even next year They are trying to get thrid parties to help out..  If you have any other questions -- let me know...  Mike Kamlet mike@vpnet.chi.il.us   ****************************************************************************  Yes, borland sells their Paradox Engine separately.  It has C, C++, and Pascal interfaces, although the underlying interface is in 'C'. Well at least for version 2.0 of the Engine which I have (costed $99 at Egghead). They now have version 3.0 of the engine, and a separate C++ class package for it.   --  Michael D. Kersenbrock ADC Kentrox - Portland, Oregon michaelk@kentrox.com uunet!kentrox!michaelk   ****************************************************************************  I've used AccSys for Paradox (new version is almost ready for Paradox 4.0) to access Paradox files from C.  Its pretty good.  Not SQL though.  Have heard of Borland Paradox Engine or some such which is supposed to do likewise, but not sure of what it is exactly.  Hope this helps, good luck! chris  From: fernand@slinky.cs.nyu.edu (Christopher Fernandes)  ****************************************************************************  Borland sells their "Paradox Engine (3.0)".  It's a library of functions for accessing paradox DB files.  It comes with libraries for: MS C 7.0 BCC 3.1 Turbo Pascal (v??) and I believe it comes with Turbo Pascal/Win libraries as well. The C libraries come in both DOS and Windows flavors (the win stuff  being dll's).    When I got it, it also came with Crystal Reports which is a graphical report generator.  It allows you to create a generic form and use it within a compiled program using Pdox Engine.

There are indeed C libs for Fox access, but I can't think of the names offhand - I'm sure someone has already written you in that regard - (I think I just saw an add for a Fox lib in the "C Users Journal", which is a good place to look for this type of package in general, by the way). I've been paying my dues to learn a lot of the quirks of PX Eng. over the past year - wouldn't recommend it for a complex multiuser app.--but I'm staying with it for now--it's like a bad marriage: I've got too much time invested in learning and work-arounds!  But if your interest is limited to a simple single-user interface (you want to build your own SQL engine, I take it), PX Engine will do the job easily - it doesn't sound like you'll be bumping into any of the gotchas.  If you do, write me; I may be able to point you in the right direction.

1	Does it mean that there is some way of transmitting some "non-trivial" data
to the KB (as opposed to standard NumLock/... On-Off, typeamatic specs.)	  I have heard that somewhere there exist programmable keyboards, eg. one can program displays on the keys to show some specific characters, et.c.   Does it mean that there is some way of transmitting some "non-trivial" data to the KB (as opposed to standard NumLock/... On-Off, typeamatic specs.) from inside the PC software? I have not found any corresponding reference in the specs for the 8042 PC-KB interface. Anyone have any ideas? (Except that they may encode data by the sequences of the standard commands mentioned above, which wouldn't look too neat, besides, what would one do from an XT?)    Great thanks in advance,

1	Heck, if IDE used DMA, then you'd hear all kinds of complaints about
ISA bus systems with more than 16M RAM not working with their IDE
drives.	IDE does not do DMA.  This is because it's like te PC AT hard disk interface.  The controller moves a sector to some buffer memory on the controller card, then the CPU moves the data from the buffer to main memory where it's needed.  If IDE doesn't work this way, then it's not compatible.  Heck, if IDE used DMA, then you'd hear all kinds of complaints about ISA bus systems with more than 16M RAM not working with their IDE drives.  16M is the DMA addressing limit of the ISA bus, and if IDE did DMA there would be trouble.  (BTW, there are DMA-enabling signals in the IDE cable spec, but the last report I heard was that they are never implemented, because it would require a different kind of IDE adapter and different drivers.)

0	Regards,
	If anyone could point me at such a thing, I'd be grateful.  [The only OEM fonts included with Windows are not Truetype.]  Regards, 
1	Your help is greatly appreciated.
	Anyway, here's  description of the card:  It is a 16-bit card, although I noticed that none of the contacts in the 16-bit extension are connected to anything.  It has 4 NS16550AN chips in sockets, and 4 corresponding connecters labeled COM1 - COM4.  There is also an external female connector with 37 pins.  There are 8 banks of 8 switches, 2 banks of 4 switches, and 7 jumpers.  I believe that I have determined, by following traces, that SW5 and SW6 (12 switches in all) control the interrupt level for each of the COM ports.  SW5[1-4] are for IRQ3, SW5[5-8] are for IRQ4, and SW6[1-4] are for IRQ5.  The other switches are beyond my meager ability to follow. 	      The only identification printed on the board is "MULTI SERIAL PORT BOARD" across the bottom.  There is a box for serial number, but it is blank. Immediately below the words "SERIAL NO", but not in the box left for the S/N, are the numbers "1990 2 8".  Anyone have any clues?  Your help is greatly appreciated.

1	As a follow on, does anyone have any comments about the use of DOS calls
   0 to 0C from within a DOS interrupt?	I have a few enquiries about PC's and compatibles in general.. Some software others hardware orientated.. (Probably the wrong newsgroup .... as everyone  claims..)  Anyway..  1) Does any one happen to have the board jumper details for a Trident 8900 SVGA graphics card (1MB) or even what the dip switches do on the end.. Mine already works fine (albeit slow) and after having blown up a monitor I found  out which switch controlled the interlace/non interlace facility..   But I'm curious as to why there are 8 dip switches on the card with apparantly little use..  2) Secondly, does anyone know why Commodore had to be so crazed in their design of the PC-40 motherboard with respect to the RAM.. (IE 512 + 512 or 640 +0K) ??  3) Can anyone supply pin details for the expansion ports for a pc (8 or 16 bit ) .. or even a sample circuit to cause an irq when a button is pressed... (Yeah I know its a piece of cake.. I'm lazy 8)  4) Software wise.. Anyone care to divulge some tips on accessing expanded RAM on a PC (from a program written in Turbo C++)....   For instance, using farcoreleft() and coreleft() return only memory available from the base 640K regardless of combinations of EMM386 etc etc... What I want is to be able to use the RAM above and beyond the 1MB boundary...  I'm not certain whether farmalloc / new actually uses it anyway but I'll  suspect not ..   5) Also.. what half brained wit created DOS so as not to be re-entrant??????    As a follow on, does anyone have any comments about the use of DOS calls    0 to 0C from within a DOS interrupt? Ie will changing the stack size on    entry be of use.. Two articles I've read on the subject have given     conflicting views... Does anyone have any views on writing direct to    screen memory in terms of portability?

0	It is true that TrueType fonts are
larger than their ATM counterparts, but ATM fonts *do* get minimal
compression.	 This isn't entirely true. It is true that TrueType fonts are larger than their ATM counterparts, but ATM fonts *do* get minimal compression. Running Stacker 3.0 report generator, I get:  	 File Type:      Compression Ratio: 	 -------------   ------------------ 	 *.TTF (TrueType)     1.4:1.0 	 *.PFB (ATM)          1.1:1.0 	 *.PFM (ATM Metric)  11.8:1.0  Although the metric files are small, they compress quite largely. And, as you can see, even the regular .PFB files have *some* compression.  So, doing the math on one such comparitive font file:  TTF Times = 83260 bytes/1.4 = 59471 bytes (compressed) PFB Times = 51549 bytes/1.1 = 46862 bytes (Compressed)  You still win out, even if the ATM Times font *isn't* compressed.  Your mileage may vary depending on compression program. 
1	I suspect it would be much, much better to
get a software disk cache instead, since you get write-caching as well.	    Yeah, there is absolutely no use for VLB except for video graphics. And no IDE could possibly take advantage the VLB, because it runs at 8 Mhz and 16 bits. Do people forget that the IDE was specifically designed to interface directly with the AT ISA bus? We've seen IDEs come out for EISA, XT ISA, and now even MCA, but at all times it was a 16 bit standard, running at somewhere near 8-10 Mhz. When you run an IDE off of the VLB, there's no way that you're running it at 33 Mhz, it would burn up. Of course same goes for SCSI, ESDI, whatever, none of them run at CPU speed.  The only way to gain advantage with a VLB IDE is to hook it up to a caching controller. I suspect it would be much, much better to get a software disk cache instead, since you get write-caching as well.   I've seen some Fuji IDE drives going as high as 1G.

1	Now I got a 20 MB harddisk from a friend of mine, and I wondered whether
I can connect this second harddisk to the same controller (there is room
for a 9 wire-bus, but not for the 34 wire bus)

How can I solve my problem, any suggestions?	I've got a Victor PC/XT with a 20 MB harddisk in it. The controller is a Toshiba MFM controller, with an additional 9 pins connector.  There are 2 busses from my harddisk to this controller. One with 9 wires and another with 34 wires.  The controller has two connectors for a 9 wire-bus and one for a 34 wire bus.  Now I got a 20 MB harddisk from a friend of mine, and I wondered whether I can connect this second harddisk to the same controller (there is room for a 9 wire-bus, but not for the 34 wire bus)  How can I solve my problem, any suggestions?  If you need more info, mail me, please (luttik@fwi.uva.nl).

It support several parallel port protocols, including 	Fast Centronics 	Microsoft Enhanced Capabilities Protocol (ECP) 	Enhanced Parallel Port (EPP) The last two handle data rates up to 2Mbytes/sec.  Is there any specification about these protocols available?  Regards,  	Christian Franke

0	If someone made a voice recognition/multimedia (sound) oriented program,
it would probably been more effective.	It seems that a particular program designed for blind people is more important than trying to interface windows with a way for blind people to use it. If someone made a voice recognition/multimedia (sound) oriented program, it would probably been more effective.  I don't know what the original purpose of interfacing windows was for the person who posted the question though. 
1	Now, here's the key: NEC *knows* that
the >=15" monitors' adjustments are very sensitive to shipping over
distances (with all the bumps, rough handling, and such) and therefore
*expect* and (at least in theory) *require* that the local *distributor*
(not dealer) have it adjusted at the *local* service centre (Bull HN
Information Systems in Toronto) before sale.	 I can't speak for MAG Innovision but as far as NEC is concerned, they are adjusted to "factory-spec" before leaving the central USA distribution point (MA) for the eastern Canadian market. Now, here's the key: NEC *knows* that the >=15" monitors' adjustments are very sensitive to shipping over distances (with all the bumps, rough handling, and such) and therefore *expect* and (at least in theory) *require* that the local *distributor* (not dealer) have it adjusted at the *local* service centre (Bull HN Information Systems in Toronto) before sale. This is the correct and probably only way of having any chance of receiving a "perfect" monitor (the definition of "perfect" seems to depend on how picky one is, in my case quite :).   I, for one, was not willing to accept what I considered a substandard monitor and, after two months of wrangling and direct contact with NEC, finally received a satisfactorily adjusted monitor (not perfect, IMHO, but a major improvement over what the dealer and distributor were trying convince me was "normal"). The short answer is no, don't accept these "imperfections" as "normal" because for the premium one pays for the larger screen monitors, one has a right to expect higher quality, and if you're persistent, you'll receive it.

1	But they also said that the Mitsubishi Diamond Pro
17 is the next best choice and that it has superb picture quality.	Windows Sources Magazine reviewed a number of 17" monitors recently and they too said that the Nanao T560i was the best monitor to get if you had the money. But they also said that the Mitsubishi Diamond Pro 17 is the next best choice and that it has superb picture quality. This monitor can be had for around $1070.  Has anyone actually seen any of these? I am also thinking of buying a 17" monitor and was going to consider the Mitsubishi. If I remember correctly, I think its viewing area is 16" measured diagonally.  Thanks.

thanks in advance	I need to implement COM3 and COM4 on a board that I'm designing and I'm finding it dificult to track down a definition (hardware that is) of COM3 and COM4.  I have the IO adresses and the fact that COM3 shares IRQ4 with COM1 and COM4 shares IRQ3 with COM2, except exactly how this IRQ sharing is done is not clear especially if the existing COM1/2 does not allow IRQ sharing. Does the standard??? allow for a different IRQ to be used and if so how.  Please answer by email to :-        neil@stone.oz.au  thanks in advance

0	It's kind of a shame, though.	I wonder whether Microsoft intended for sysedit to be used, or if it was just a holdover from the testing period and they forgot to take it out. The reason I think this is because there is absolutely no mention in the manuals about this program, and there is no online help for it (just an About entry under the File menu). The program looks like something that was intended for internal use only. It's kind of a shame, though. It would have made a nice multi-file replacement for Notepad.

0	In the [386enh] section of SYSTEM.INI, you can specify a parameter:

	PageOverCommit=multiplier

The following description is from the Windows Resource Kit:

	This entry specifies the multiplier what determines the amount of
	linear address space the VMM will create for the system, which is
	computed by rounding up the amount of available physical memory to
	the nearest 4 MB and then multiplying that value by the value
	specified for PageOverCommit=.	I think the support droid was malfunctioning and confused the disk space limit with the virtual address space limit.  As far as the disk is concerned, you are limited only by the amount of contiguous free space. The limit that causes the message, "Windows will only use ...," is the amount of virtual address space that the Virtual Memory Manager will create, and this is a function of the amount of free memory that you have when Windows starts.  In the [386enh] section of SYSTEM.INI, you can specify a parameter:  	PageOverCommit=multiplier  The following description is from the Windows Resource Kit:  	This entry specifies the multiplier what determines the amount of 	linear address space the VMM will create for the system, which is 	computed by rounding up the amount of available physical memory to 	the nearest 4 MB and then multiplying that value by the value 	specified for PageOverCommit=.  Increasing this value increases the 	amount of available linear address space, causing the size of data 	structures to increase.  This also increases paging activity 	proportionately and can slow down the system.  You can specify a 	value between 1 and 20.  The default is 4.  To change this entry, 	you must edit SYSTEM.INI.

0	Where ever the mail is forwarded to that person gets a message header
then a message saying "Boudary:= (error garbage code stuff)".	There is a glitch somewhere in the system though.  I don't know if it is MS mail, the gateway or the VAX here on campus that is choking in the mail that is sent.  The scenario is this.  The outgoing mail goes to a Unix system which then routes the mail where it needs to go.  If that mail is routed to the VAX, the VAX has problems some times receiving the mail. Most messages do get through this way except if someone has there mail on the VAX forwarded to some other location.  That is the main gotcha. Where ever the mail is forwarded to that person gets a message header then a message saying "Boudary:= (error garbage code stuff)".  If you can stay away from sending to a VAX you are ok.  The system people of course say that the VAX is not the problem, the gateway is probably the problem.  If anyone wants to get help it is only $175.00 for one support call. (until problem is worked out)  Phooey to that I say.  I am looking vigorously for a better Idea.    If you go forward on any of this and find out anything knew,  please drop me a note - anyone.  The next itteration is supposed to have tcp/ip built in THEY say........  The netxt itteration of w4wg  Good Luck!!!!!

0	Also, it would
   have been nice if there was an "ALWAYS ON TOP" setting for the little
   window containing the workspace buttons.	1. WORKSPACES 1.10 (wspace.zip)                                 This was the smallest and simplest    of the workspace managers that I found.  It is very easy to use.    It displays a small window, containing 6 buttons, plus an extra    button for configuration purposes.  One annoying feature was the    title window that is first presented when it is run - you must press    a key (not a mouse button!) for the thing to go away.  Also, it would    have been nice if there was an "ALWAYS ON TOP" setting for the little    window containing the workspace buttons.  Maybe some user-specified    strings on the buttons instead of the numbers one to six might be    a nice feature.  The simplicity and ease of use of this workspace    manager makes it an attractive package.  2. WORKSHIFT 1.6 (wrksft16.zip)                                While this workspace manager offered a    few features that WORKSPACES 1.10 lacked, it was quite time consuming    to set things up.  With WORKSPACES 1.10, all but the first workspace    is initially empty.  With WORKSHIFT 1.6, you need to take "snapshots"    of how you want each of your workspaces to look like - i.e. what     applications they contain.  Also, the main window is quite large,    but this does allow you to have a small view of what is in each workspace.    With WORKSPACES 1.10, there was no facility for viewing what was in    a workspace without switching to it.  WORKSHIFT 1.6 provides this    viewing functionality which is quite useful.  3. BIGDESK 2.30 and BACKMENU (backdesk.zip)                             This is an interesting package, which contains    a few other goodies as well as a workspace manager.  Other goodies    include "Backmenu", which provides a pop-up root menu when you    press a certain mouse button - just like in X-Windows.  The menu    is totally configurable, offering unlimited depth of cascading menus,    which is provides quite handy access to applications.  You could    say it is a menu-based alternative to the program manager.  Also    bundled in "backdesk.zip" is a program called "WRUN", which allows    you to run windows applications from a DOS shell under WINDOWS    instead of using the File Manager to run applications.      The actual workspace manager is called BIGDESK 2.30.  BIGDESK works quite    differently to the other two workspace managers in that it    doesn't provide a certain number of disjoint and separate workspaces.    In fact, it basically enlarges your desktop by a configurable amount,    and you choose which region of the desktop you want your screen to    focus in on.  This means you can have windows overlapping between different    viewing regions, unlike the first two workspace managers in which    each workspace was isolated from the other one.  The BIGDESK control window    allows to to move windows around your enlarged desktop.  Basically    the control window provides a small scale view of your viewing area    while your actual computer screen provides a large scale or blow-up    of a particular section.
1	As far as I know the CMOS clock
keeps the right time (in fact about 7 seconds/day better than DOS's clock).	Somebody might be able to correct the details in case I've mis-rememberred them, but I think you have to change the menu program (if you have the sources) or add a TSR or system patch or something.  As far as I know the CMOS clock keeps the right time (in fact about 7 seconds/day better than DOS's clock).

The second bank is labeled "IRQ" and has the following labels:
5C

I have determined that the C1 & C2 jumpers tell it to address the first
serial port as COM1 or COM2.	There are 2 banks of jumpers. The first one is labeled as follows: C1 C2 S2 P2 P1 G  The second bank is labeled "IRQ" and has the following labels: 5C 5S 4 3 3S 2C 2S  I have determined that the C1 & C2 jumpers tell it to address the first serial port as COM1 or COM2. The P1,P2 jumpers tell it to use the printer port as LPT1 or LPT2. I am guessing that the "G" enables the game port and the "S2" SHOULD enable the second serial port, but I can't get it to work. I have tried numerous setting on the IRQ bank without success. I assume that this bank must tell the card which IRQ's to use for both ports, but I don;t know how.  Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!!  EBD --  Elliot Dierksen   "Is that a real poncho... I mean is that a Mexican poncho or                    is that a Sears  poncho?

1	So.. REM out
the Adaptec drivers once more.. and reboot.	So you add the BusLogic drivers to the config.sys on the CD-ROM boot disk, and REM out the Adaptec drivers.  Then you install the whole 1st half of the Beta.. and it won't work! IBM nicely copies in the Adaptec drivers once again. (Thanks IBM!) So.. REM out the Adaptec drivers once more.. and reboot. If you have everything in the right order.. it will work.  Things are pretty smooth through the rest of the installation.. except OS/2 will try to install the Adaptec SCSI drivers once again at the end... so.. you are off to more REM statements and more fun.   The BT 542Bk comes with drivers and costs the same as the Adaptec cards that do not come with drivers. The DOS drivers work great. This card can easily be configured to work with 8 different sets of I/O ports (and you can use multiple host adapters in one machine) If you get a new card.. it will also be able to support up to 8 GB drives under DOS.  Hope this helps..  - Dan

0	If someone
converts a Type 1 font to TT they'll only get the characters in the font of orgin.	TrueType is a much richer and more robust hinting language than Type 1 (the hinting of diagonals for instance, which TT does and Type 1 cannot). If you check out the Windows 3.1 core fonts (Times, Arial, Courier, Symbol, Wingdings) you'll see what can be done with TT. There are other fonts out there that have been hand-hinted and not just converted. Some of the Microsoft TT Font Pack 2 fonts are hinted very well.   Again, not true. The characters in a TT or Type 1 font depend on the maker. If someone converts a Type 1 font to TT they'll only get the characters in the font of orgin. TT allows for much more flexibility in this area as well. You can have thousands of glyphs in a TT font file (Mac/PS/Windows/Unicode char set) and use the characters appropriate for the particular platform you are running the font on. For instance, all or our fontpack 2 TT fonts have the Mac/Windows char set in them. The metrics of the fonts are such that if the font is brought over to the mac the user will have access to the full mac char set.    Hope this clears up some of the confusion. Feel free to contact me if anyone would like more info.  Regards,

0	Altering the paragraph (0182) or cedilla (0184) does alter their font
graphics displayed however!!	I believe the character used by W4W is the period-centred (0183). This character shows up with the windows Charmap display as the hollow box which tends to confirm this.  I have edited the corel font with Fontmonger and changing the font graphics for the 0183 character makes no difference to the font output in Charmap or W4W. Altering the paragraph (0182) or cedilla (0184) does alter their font graphics displayed however!!  Is the W4W character used to indicate spaces the period-centred character?

1	If you create a new floppy for your a: drive (that is the 5 1/4"), turn on
the "modify" switch of vga-copy.	I think VGA-Copy can do what you need.  If you create a new floppy for your a: drive (that is the 5 1/4"), turn on the "modify" switch of vga-copy. When you boot using this diskette, a message appears:  This is no system disk, you can 1) replace disk with another, 2) boot from Harddisk or 3) switch drives and reboot (that is, a: becomes b:, b: becomes a:) Type your choice:  When you select the third item, you can boot from b: which is now called a: . Seems to work very good, for example booting drdos6 from the installation disks in 3.5" format was no problem for a friend of mine (I have only a 3.5" a: drive)  Hope that helps Robert  P.S.: VGA-Copy is shareware, so it's easy to get.

You realize, of course, that inevitably some anal retentive moron is going to come along and wag his fingers and his jowls in outrage that personal politics are more important than [SMCAP][BOLD][Font:God 999pt.]The Law[smcap][bold][font].  But that's irrelevant to the problem here.  Windows came with my system, but on 5.25" disks.  I hate using 5.25" disks, so I copied them over to high density 3.5"'s using xcopy.  It worked fine.  In fact, for a while I was changing configurations and whatnot so much that I decided to try putting them on the hard disk.  Not only can you copy them over with one disk per directory, but if you want to, you can simply copy them all into one directory.  Makes it a lot nicer when you're switching printer emulations around.  Norton 6.0 I don't have much experience with, but when a friend's system crashed, we restored from a backup rather than from the originals, and it worked fine.  This would imply that arj a -r norton c:\nu would create a workable backup, and if you did a full install the first time, you've got the whole thing.

1	This is what all this is about.	 I get different transfer rates out of my IDE when I change my ISA bus speed.   IDE is just a variant of the old IBM- MFM AT controller.  (at least that's how it looks from a software point of view).  It was never meant to be an all-encompassing protocal/standard to be implimented across different platforms.  Is there any argument that  IDE can (or can't) transfer data from the IDE drive at least as fast as the drive is able to provide the data?  Are SCSI versions of IDE drives able to deliver higher sustained transfer rates to their SCSI interface (because of a higher RPM platter, different arrangement of heads, etc?)?   If data is going from one drive to another, and if SCSI has the ability to perform that transfer without the data having to go through the CPU or main memory, then yes, that is the optimal way to do it.  As far as I know, IDE can't do that.  But when the CPU wants data from both drives (data to be stored in main memory) are you saying that SCSI can grab data from both drives  at the same time *and* store/transfer that data to main memory also at the same time?  Working off 1 IRQ and 1 DMA channel on an ISA (or whatever) bus?   A friend of mine just got a Maxtor 245 meg IDE drive for $320.  (that's 245 million bytes, or 234 mega-bytes).  With the basic $20 interface, he gets close to 1 meg/sec transfer on his 286-20.  Does your figure include a few hundred $$$ for SCSI drivers?   So you're saying that SCSI would have been the default interface type, considering that the vast majority of PC's don't have cd-rom drives or tape backups or etc?  That most PC's only have (or had) 1 hard drive and run DOS?  That SCSI hard drives cost a lot more than MFM or RLL drives at the time?  (and how common were SCSI drives under 80 megs 4 to 10 years ago?)  There's a lot more than the lack of a common interface card that prevented SCSI from becoming the connection medium of choice.   But on that point, is it faster?  This is what all this is about.  Do you get more performance for the money.  For all the people that will only have a single hard drive in their system (regardless of the OS) will the SCSI choice really give them more performance than IDE?   True, but expandibility can also start on the bus, which means the option is there for cd-rom drives or tape backups that run off their own cards.   No argument.  This is always held up to the first time SCSI buyer as the best reason.  But how many SCSI devices will the first time SCSI buyer eventually acquire?  Again does it make sense to go SCSI for a single hard drive system?   With all the postings on the SCSI I or II specs, are you really sure that PC and Apple SCSI hard drives are compatible?  And even if they are,  is the data accessible from either machine (ie are there no formatting/ partitioning or file table differences?)  Is it really plug'n'play?   So the C: drive on the connor becomes a logical D: drive to DOS.  Is this really a problem?     After having two IDE drives in my system for temporary file transfers, I have never seen any differences when switching between drives, nor have I ever seen any differences when transfering files between drives or to/from the same drive.   That is nice (as long as the power supply can keep up).  I do believe that there is the possibility for up to 4 IDE drives on a PC.

1	Would this mean I can not install the network software because it will not
be serialised for this hardware with a failed drive?	My investigations indicate that drive C is a type 27 (1024 cylinders, 9 sides). When CMOS set this way, COMPSURF runs happily, with 13 bad blocks.  I use PREPARE to Hotfix the one internal drive.  Install will proceed "successfully", but when I try to boot the server, it reports that the software is not serialised for this hardware.  Internal examination indicates that the keycard is present, and there is one disk drive (or at least one large single unit).   Attempts to configure a second drive in CMOS result in drive not ready errors.  Questions: ========= The software is Netware 286 Level II and I can see burnt on to the screen SFT Netware 286 Level II V2.0a. However, to configure netware for level II (mirrored or duplexed disks) requires a second disk, yes?   So how is the Novell Server 286A normally configured?  1. Can I install SFT Netware 286 Level II V2.0a as Level I, or is this what is causing my serialisation error? 2. Is the Novell Server 286A normally equipped with two hard drives, one of which has failed? 3. Would this mean I can not install the network software because it will not be serialised for this hardware with a failed drive? 4. What else can cause a serialisation error? 5. What happens if the keycard fails? 6. Am I doing something wrong? Can someone knowledgeable offer some comments and guides.  Thanks for your time.  Apology: ======= I appreciate that I have posted this request somewhat widely. As I'm dealing with somewhat archaic hardware and software I'm hoping that by casting my net further, I'm more likely to capture someone who has met this system before. I believe I can justify the groups to which I am posting. Please feel free to correct me if you feel this is an inappropriate place to post this.

1	I normally don't write disclaimers,
but this time maybe I'd better.	In going with the modern trend, the Orchid P9000 card only supports 16 colors in 640x480 mode without a driver.  Of course, this breaks any DOS program which uses SVGA modes (like most of my CD-ROMs).  The Compudyne Whiplash VGA, Orchid Fahrenheit 1280, and Orchid F. VLB all share this limitation.  Those are all S3 cards, which means it is an S3 problem for them (the P9000 uses a Weitek VGA chip which also doesn't support them).  The Hercules Graphite card does seem to have these modes, but I didn't run the same test cases as I did on the other boards during the brief time I had it.  It was able to print the splash screen for the Grolier's Encyclopedia, though, which the S3 cards just printed as hash, which is why I suspect the SVGA modes are supported.  The supported resolutions really annoy me.  You can do 1280x1024 at 75Hz if you tell the driver you have an NEC 5FG (they only have about six monitors listed plus 'Generic', and if you choose Generic you can't get any high refreshes at ALL).  But at 1024x768 you are limited to 70Hz.  Seems to me that the hardware should be able to support the bandwidth (if it can do 75Hz at 1280 it sure should be able to do it at 1024!).  Higher vertical resolution was the main reason I bought the card over the Orchid F. VLB I currently have, and it will do 1024x768x70 Hz as well.  The higher graphics modes all crash HP Dashboard.  I just got off the phone with Orchid, and with the 1.1 drivers (I don't know what I have) he was unable to recreate the problem.  On the plus side, their tech rep was as helpful as he could be and booted up the program on his computer to verify he didn't have the problem.  He didn't know why they limited the refresh to 70 Hz either.  The board is faster that the OFVLB for most things according to the Hercules Speedy program. This program tests various operations and reports the results in pixels/second.  I don't have the numbers for the Graphite card, but they were close to half of the OFVLB (ie, slower) but that was running in a 20MHz 386, ISA, so the numbers aren't really comparable.  The following numbers were all obtained using a 486, 33 MHz, AIR motherboard (UMC chipset), with 8 MB memory.  I give ranges because the program reports the numbers as it computes them, and these tend to jump around a bit.   K means thousand (not 1024), M means million, pixels per second               Orchid Fahrenheit VLB                  Orchid P9000 Chip                 S3 805                          Weitek 9000 DIB to Screen        182K - 190K                     228K - 240K Memory to Screen     5.9M - 6.2M                     8.4M - 8.9M Screen to Screen     14M - 14.8M                     29M - 30.8M Vector, solid        2.4M                            2.8M - 2.9M Vector, styled       55K - 58K                       449K - 473K Polygon, shaded      1.8M - 2.1M                     1.6M - 1.9M Polygon, hatched     6.9M - 7.9M                     1.3M - 1.7M Ternary Rops         1.9M - 2.4M                     477K - 520K Font                 130K - 160K                     46K - 55K / 1.2M  The DIB to Screen test takes a device independent bitmap of a face and transfers it to the screen.  I have no idea what is being done internally as far as conversions go.  The memory to screen takes the same face and copies it to the screen, my guess is after it has been rasterized into a bitmap that can just be copied to the video display.  The screen to screen test copies that face from place to place on the screen.  Awesome!  Interestingly, the solid vectors and shaded polygons show no improvement, and hatched polygons (ie, filled with cross-hatching) and Ternary Rops (whatever they are.  Graphics operations like XORs maybe????) are a dead loss on the 9000.  I give two numbers for the 9000 fonts, because I think they are caching. When the fonts are first drawn on the screen they are done fairly slowly -- 1/3 the speed of the OFVLB.  Then the speed increases dramatically.  Sounds like programming to a benchmark to me....  I make no claims that these numbers mean anything at all.  Its just what I saw when I ran them on my computer.  I normally don't write disclaimers, but this time maybe I'd better.  My testing is totally unconnected with my work (I program under UNIX on Decstations) is done completely without the knowledge, blessing, or equipment of my company.

The EMX system for OS/2 gives you most of the standard UNIX system calls for recompiling your UNIX programs under OS/2.  Not quite the same thing as actually running UNIX programs directly in either case, but EMX makes OS/2 almost as compatible with UNIX systems as many UNIX systems are with each other.  And, best of all, EMX is free.  :-)  There is a similar system (GO32) for DOS, but it doesn't work with Windows, as far as I know.   Should add in the cost for DOS with both Geos and Windows, neither of which is a standalone OS at this point.  Neither OS/2 nor UNIX requires DOS.  BTW, two of the best unices I've seen for the pee cee are UNIXWare ($300 for the personal edition) and LINUX (free).  So I don't agree that "a good one costs $400-$700."  :-)  And, if you really want to check out the various options available to you, you should also look into DESQview and DESQview/X.  cheers

1	This allows the best of BOTH
worlds: high SCSI-2 speeds and cheeper SCSI-1 costs {FULL SCSI-2 hardware
(port, electronic controller, etc) is VERY expensive.	The article in PC Mag 4/27/93:29 was talking about SCSI-1 {SCSI-2 uses TEN (10) devices in it native mode, outside its native mode it behaves a lot like SCSI-1 (7 devices, slower through put}  From your own figures SCSI-1 is indeed twice ESDI as the article pointed out as for "20% faster then IDE" that seems to be 8-bit SCSI-1 using a SCSI-2  contoler chip {The Mac Quadra uses a SCSI-2 controler chip for its SCSI-1 and gets 6MB/s through put for asynchronous {8-bit} SCSI-1, far in excess of a normal SYNCHRONOUS SCSI-1 output} 120% of 8.3 is 9.96 which is near the burst of a SCSI-1 machine with a SCSI-2 controller chip.  The PC world seems to have SCSI-1 and SCSI-2 mixed up.  Fact is SCSI-2  controler chips allow near SCSI-2 speeds through a SCSI-1 device {As shown in the Mac Quadra} which skews some of the data of SCSI-1 vs IDE or ESDI test. I agree that the article COULD have stated that the "20% faster then IDE" came off a SCSI-1 device with a SCSI-2 chip.  Maybe it was there and the EDITOR killed it because the article was dealing with SCSI-1 NOT SCSI-2 and he did not understand the effect of a SCSI-1 device with a SCSI-2 controller chip. SCSI-1 chips are limited to 5/MB max.  SCSI-1 devices with SCSI-2 chips {becoming common} produce up to 10Mb/s in 8-bit mode and 20MB/s in 16-bit mode {the fast version, SCSI-1 ports cannot use wide SCSI}.  Of cource the prime piece of wierdness is that SCSI-1 devices HAVE SCSI-2 chips {or more accurately the machine does}. This allows the best of BOTH worlds: high SCSI-2 speeds and cheeper SCSI-1 costs {FULL SCSI-2 hardware (port, electronic controller, etc) is VERY expensive.  It ALSO creates a logistic NIGHTMARE as to how fast SCSI-1 goes.

1	).	I have waded through the mass of SCSI-IDE posting, but I missed any answers to a question posted early on --  Has anyone (successfully) put both SCSI and IDE hard drives on the same system?  I am particularly interested in having the SCSI as the _boot_ drive.  For those who have managed this feat, I would appreciate a bit more information, such as what drives, which SCSI controller, and (if possible) what motherboard & BIOS (plus any other relevant info.).

0	Any help would be appreciated.	I'm trying to get a drum program to work that I downloaded from ftp.cica.indiana.edu in the pub/pc/win3/sounds directory.  It's called drum.zip.    I have an ATI Stereo FX card with the latest Windows drivers installed.  When I try to run the drum program, it reports that a MIDI device is not installed, however the drivers utility in the control panel reports that it is installed.    Anyone have any idea how to set up the MIDI device so that the drum program will work with my setup?  What I'm trying to do is use my computer as a metronome.  Someone suggested that I try one of the drum machines that are circulating around out there.  Any help would be appreciated.  Thanks,  Terry

1	Thanks.	I just got a problem, I have a cheapo 2400bps modem which I use to connect to my university, but I get too much garbage on the screen. I do know it's because the noise in the line (I can actually hear it).  So my question is will an error correction protocol help to eliminate this garbage?, my modem doesn't have any of these on hardware, can a software implemented protocol do the trick?  Thanks.

1	In order for them to work properly, I would have to find out what DMA
channel the XGA-2 card uses and then simply configure the SCSI HA to
use a different DMA channel for its DMA xfers.	Seriously, busmastering adapter have their own DMA ability, they don't use the motherboards on-board DMA(which is *MUCH* slower).  ISA has no bus arbitration, so if two busmastering cards in 1 ISA system try to do DMA xfers on the same DMA channel the system will lock or  crash.(I forget)  Their are 8 DMA channels in an ISA system. 0-7. 0-3 are 8-bit & 4-7 are 16-bit.  The system uses DMA 0, a SoundBlaster uses DMA 1.  I could buy a busmastering XGA-2 video card & a busmastering SCSI HA.  In order for them to work properly, I would have to find out what DMA channel the XGA-2 card uses and then simply configure the SCSI HA to use a different DMA channel for its DMA xfers.  I don't know if multiple DMA xfers can go on at the same time on ISA. I'm not sure if they can on EISA systems either.  I do know that on EISA/MCA systems, you can allow BM cards to use the same DMA channel.

Unfortunately I can't get it to work... I have a little demo here by the name of Cronologia (Which the schematic came from) and all I can get it to pump out of the box is data type hash/static with a small amount of music signal behind it - it's even worse than the speaker inside the machine.  Does anybody out in net.colourful.computer.world have any ideas/suggestions/ better designs/improvements/wastepaper bin... etc?

I mess with this older stuff alot.   Kinda fun.  8)       First problem I can forsee is that the ST-251 will not be compadible with that WD card unless it has the right bios rom.        Check the numbers on it.  It should be the only non-smt chip on the board.  Slightly below center, and left.    The bios should read  either :     62-000042-015 or              62-000094-0x2       If the last 3 digits are 013, you got problems.       Looks right.   W5 and W7 are factory jumped (with a trace) between pins 1 and 2 to select the primary controller address.       Looks right.    [art deleted]         I notice you left out the S1 jumper table settings.   Those are what control what drive the controller thinks it has.   If you have the 62-000042-015 rom, set it like this:                5 + +    open               6 + +    open                            7 + +    open                       8 + +    open               4 + +    closed               3 + +    closed               2 + +    open               1 + +    open      Note:   those are how WD runs the numbers on the jumper block. Top to bottom.   +'s represent the jumper pins.    Pins 3,4, and 8 select the first drive setting (drive 0) and pins 1,2 and 7 select the second drive (drive 1).           If you have the 62-000094 rom, it's a auto-config, and I'll have to look up how to do it... I don't have the big book right here.         See above.  You might have problems if the S1 jumpers are not right.   Also,  at the risk of being insulting, make sure the cables are on right and good. 8).    On the jumper on the 251, try moving it to the opposite side of the drive.    It's one or the other.         The narrow data cable goes to J2.   I've thrown it on J3 a few times and banged my head for a day.....        Dunno.    IBM roms had to be later than 10/27/82.   A quick way to check is to boot dos and run debug.   Enter:                 -d f000:fff5 fffc    (the - is the debug prompt)         This will return the rom date, if it's of any use.         If I oversimplified any of the above, I appologize.     It's just hard to know what caliber of person I'm talking to. 8).                       -->   Bob Valentine  <--                     --> ravalent@mailbox.syr.edu <--      From chpp@unitrix.utr.ac.za Mon Apr  5 06:33:46 1993 Received: from unitrix.utr.ac.za by ponder (5.61/1.36) 	id AA16194; Mon, 5 Apr 93 06:32:59 -0500 Received: by unitrix.utr.ac.za (Smail3.1.28.1 #1) 	id m0nfpMA-0001X7C; Mon, 5 Apr 93 13:28 GMT Message-Id: <m0nfpMA-0001X7C@unitrix.utr.ac.za> From: chpp@unitrix.utr.ac.za (Prof P.

0	Otherwise wait for next release, like I am.	There is an INDEX ascii file there, which lists the programs in that directory and what they do.  unfortunately this beta will also disable netbeui and tcp/ip over your primary nic, so if you really want to run it, get yourself an extra nic and bind it to that.    Otherwise wait for next release, like I am.

0	If you are using a disk compressor, though, be aware
	that TrueType fonts will compress, whereas Type-1 fonts will not
	(they are encrypted).	    1.	TrueType font files are at least 1/3 larger than their Type-1 	equivalents.  If you are using a disk compressor, though, be aware 	that TrueType fonts will compress, whereas Type-1 fonts will not 	(they are encrypted).      2.	With a 300 dpi laser printer, the "artificial bold" version of a 	TrueType font is indistingishable from the original, forcing me to 	install the actual bold (and bold-italic, etc.) variants if I want 	to use them.  Type-1 PostScript fonts under ATM generate a visually 	distinct bold variant from the base font.  I realize that the 	artificial bold font that ATM generates is aesthetically inferior 	to the hand-generated bold TrueType variant, but it is sufficient 	for my needs, and not having to install bold variants saves me 50% 	on disk space (uncompressed).

1	Retail outlets are desirable, however, to those people who aren't interested
in learning about computers enough to make their own decisions.	Phone support is quick and competent from many mail order firms, but not so quick and not so competent from others (Gateway included).  But my experience with computer retailers (which is significant) has lead to the conclusion that sales personnel and retail-technical personnel are forbidden to actually learn about the products they sell.  Talk about incompetent!  O.K., so a few percent of their answers are correct, but those salesmen don't even realize how stupid they are.   ...  .......  O.K.  ...I'll settle down now....  .... let me catch my breath.....  ..  Fact: retail stores never provide a better value in terms of price per product.  Retail outlets are desirable, however, to those people who aren't interested in learning about computers enough to make their own decisions.  This is fine; for example most of my education about carpeting, wall paper, lawn mowers, microwave ovens, etc. has come from sales personnel.  I assume I must be an idiot.  But I don't care about those things.  I do, however, care about my computer - i.e. I demand features and performance, and I'll be damned if I'll pay some high-school drop out commission on an over-rated, over-priced system and in the process be subjected to his distorted B.S.  G.L.
1	Anybody with more info?	    Did I once hear that in order for the date to advance, something, like a  clock, *has* to make a Get Date system call? Apparently, the clock hardware interrupt and BIOS don't do this (date advance) automatically. The Get Date call notices that a "midnight reset" flag has been set, and then then advances the date.  Anybody with more info?

0	With the hardware scroll enabled, applications write garbage outside the
  window.	I have (had) several problems with the card. - Applications crashed when moving the mouse (VGA mode). Fixed by removing   the line STACKS=0,0 from config.sys. The default value STACKS=9,256   does just fine. - Random white pixels all over the screen when moving the mouse, in a   256 color graphical mode (the hardware cursor modes). Fixed by turning   off the hardware scroll ("24xmode scrolloff") before entering the graphics   mode. This also fixed the problem of the windowed DOS boxes under windows.   With the hardware scroll enabled, applications write garbage outside the   window. - The screensavers do not remove the cursor in 256 color modes (hardware   cursor). I don't know if this is a windows problem or a driver problem.   Clearly there should be two types of cursor removing functions: a remove-   for-draw, which can be ignored for hardware cursors and a remove-   unconditionally. Do other cards with hardware cursors have the same problem? - The VESA driver does not support the 640x480x16M TrueColor mode. (Universal   VESA drivers do not run at all).

The alternative approach (to CISC),  which has been adopted by many in  recent years, has come to be known as "RISC": the Reduced  Instruction Set Computer.  This can be characterised simply as  "Simpler is Faster"; by simplifying the design (e.g.  by reducing  the variety of instructions & addressing modes), the hardware can be  designed to run faster.  Even at the cost of needing more  instructions, the same task can be done more quickly by the simpler,  faster design.   A typical RISC processor will:      o provide a large number of registers (e.g.  32);      o perform all data operations on registers;      o provide few addressing modes (e.g. immediate or 'register + offset');      o only allow load & store operations to access memory;      o only use a few instruction formats;      o only support a few data types (e.g. integer, unsigned, floating).
0	I stumbled onto a global workaround.	In a nutshell the problem is that I lose the first 0.625 inches of information from my left margin, be it white space or TrueType font output, and margins are not preserved on subsequent pages past the first.  WordPerfect had a workaround consisting of using the "Default" location for the printers instead of "Tractor" or "Manual".  They have also filed this as a bug and are continuing to investigate it.  MS Write, of course, has no problem with these printer drivers, proving that Microsoft knows something the rest of us don't!  Are you surprised?  I'm not.  Publish It!/WIN is still investigating this problem, and while I was consider- my options (rejecting the one about buying an $800 DTP package, for *surely* they wouldn't have this problem, right?) I stumbled onto a global workaround.  WORKAROUND ---------- Go into the Windows 3.1 control panel, select printers, select your Citizen printer driver, select SETUP, and select a custom size of 850 x 1132.  Like magic, all of your problems will go away.  Ask me no questions and I'll tell you no lies!  -- Mike   ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Disclaimer: My opinions do not necessarily reflect those of my employer. ========================================================================
1	But it goes both ways so can't conclude anything.	We have plenty of computer labs where the computers are left on all the time. I don't see any shorter lifespan than the ones we have in the offices which does get turned off at the end of the day. In fact, some of the computers in the labs have outlived some of the same ones in the offices. But it goes both ways so can't conclude anything.
0	Any information at all would be nice.	At the end of the summer I'm planning on getting a new computer (486DX50 or 486DX2/66) and have been poking around in Computer Shopper.  Anyway I saw the ads for the Diamond Viper (Local Bus, 2MB memory, 50 million+ WinMarks) and was wondering if anyone has had any experience with it (good/bad/not worth the money/etc.)  Any information at all would be nice.  Also, a few other questions.  Anyone know of a good cheap 15"+ 1024x768 NI monitor?  And what is a good CD-ROM drive that meets MPC standards and is controlled via SCSI?  How about a 250MB tape drive on SCSI?
1	These are in very limited supply, however.	Basically, I have all the standard parts EXCEPT:  Motherboard Battery Power Supply  I've got a few of the accessories, too - just ask.  These are in very limited supply, however.  I've basically just cannibalized a couple of old machines.  If you are interested, please e-mail me.
1	The performance difference (under Linux)
is great enough to be worthwhile.	 I only wait when the difference between my current system and the new stuff is big enough to warrant changing. For instance, I'll be upgrading my 486 33 to a 486DX-2 66 EISA, VLB board RSN. The performance difference (under Linux) is great enough to be worthwhile. At the same time I'll be buying a new graphic card and new SCSI controller. I'll be buying an S3 card 'cos they're fast enough, I have X11 drivers for them and it'll have 2MB VRAM just like a Weitek 9000 card. It will also be MUCH cheaper. When affordable 4MB cards arrive, I'll buy one.   Over the last year I've done much the same. But now I need a 19" monitor, more memory (20MB just ain't enough), a GB disk (1.2GB and no space left...). Oh well, stay single, don't smoke and you may afford it this year ;-) 
1	Where can I get one?		I'm the proud owner of an IBM AT without a battery. I know it hooks into jumper J21, but I need more info so I can replace it. What's its voltage? Any suggestions for replacement? Where can I get one? Please respond to : 			grisch@uceng.uc.edu 
1	This leads
me to believe that my stack is filling up and overflowing.	All it is doing is running in a loop while the operator is idle and after a while of sitting, it will screw up all the variables. This leads me to believe that my stack is filling up and overflowing.    Does the program take memory up when it is calling void functions that do not return anything??  	I have been working on this problem for days and I would really appreciate any responce.  If this is not the correct newsgroup, I will gladly re-post, but this is the only I could find.
0	Stefan	I have a 386sx25 notebook with windows 3.1 running fine. WINWORD 2.0 and  QUATTRO-PRO for windows also work fine when no virtual memory is used.  Switching on the virtual memory option these programs (probably others too)  don't work, the system crashes. The same programs work well with arbitrary  virtual memory on two other desktop PC's. What am I doing wrong?  If you can help, please mail to me directly, if possible.  Thank you very much in advance.  Stefan

1	How much usually does a SCSI control cost?	        Please forgive me if this is FAQ. If there is source on this kind of info,  please let me know. I just got a 286 station (around 21*16.5*7 in dimension), and I am thinking about upgrade it to a 486 or 386.          The station has a power supply, two floppy disk drives, and the big case. I have SONY 1304 monitor, SyQuest drive (Mac), and maybe a cd-rom reader (Mac) for it. Here are the questions I have so far: 1) Is there a 486 motherboard at this dimension that I could use the case? 2) The original owener has the controller for floppy drive and hard disk removed. Can I use them to control these devices under 486? How much do I have to pay for a new controllers if the old ones won't work? 3) How can I make SyQuest (SCSI) and cd-rom (SCSI) work on this station?  I heard that there is a cheap sound board that has SCSI controller built-in? What's quality of this board? How much usually does a SCSI control cost? Is there any ftp sites that has SyQuest driver or cd-rom driver for the PC if I can have everything hooked up OK?4) What I want is a 486 motherboard, a sound board to make it a MPC-  quality station. How much would it cost to do that? Is it worth the hussle than just buy a new 486 station? BTW, I need to buy a keyboard for it too.  Any input is welcome.  Thank you.

1	The IDE controller's instruction
sheet says it supports two drives; I think I've configured the CMOS
correctly; the power's plugged in properly; I even learned about the
master/slave relationship that two HDs are supposed to have (didn't
know PCs were into S&M!	Anyway, I can't seem to get the bloody thing up.  I've managed to get one or the other drive up (with the other disconnected), but not both at the same time; whenever I try, the thing hangs during bootup - never gets past the system test.  The IDE controller's instruction sheet says it supports two drives; I think I've configured the CMOS correctly; the power's plugged in properly; I even learned about the master/slave relationship that two HDs are supposed to have (didn't know PCs were into S&M! 8^) and I think I configured the jumpers properly (the 85MB one is the master, the new 210MB one is the slave).  The only thing I can think of is maybe I'm doing the cabling wrong.  I've tried several combinations:  controller - master - slave controller - slave - master master - controller - slave  None of them worked.  Unfortunately, I can't think of any others.  Another possibility is that the 85MB one is already partitioned into two seperate drives, C and D, and the CMOS asks for "C: drive" and "D: drive" setup info rather than "drive 1" and "drive 2" like most others I've seen.  Could this be confusing things?  So, I need HELP!  The drive came bereft of any docs, except for some info for the CMOS setup; the controller has a little piece of paper about the size of an index card; I cannibalized the cable (it's one of those with a connector at each end and the one in the middle, so it looks like a serial connection); now I be lost!  Many, many thanks in advance!  This is practically an emergency (I have two papers to do on this thing for Monday!)!  Help! --

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=	I thought this was a neat feature until I noticed that when an image is re-sized, the scanning frequency is necessarily changed.  This causes digital multiscan monitors like my MAG MX17F to get confused as to which mode to use if the frequency gets too far from the standard selections.  For this reason, I use the "factory defaults" for position/size on the ATI card and adjust each mode individually (only the first time) at the monitor.  The MAG (and many other multiscan monitors) has (have) the ability to recall these settings the next time each mode is "detected". --   =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

0	Both these unix's are quite robust.	 This list appears to imply, that MS-windows that has a cost listed above at $70, comes with a C compiler, C++ and Fortran. It does not, of course. These are expensive add-ons that drive the price WAY beyond $70. ( I don't know if the same applies to OS/2 )  As far as unix is concerned; There is a free unix, linux, that has cc, ~c++, fortran ( f2c ), Xwindows and many other features besides, with a large number of utilities that can be optionally added. And there is also a free 386BSD I believe. Both these unix's are quite robust. You can check out comp.os.linux  If you don't want to "throw our many down the tubes", you've got to break that list down a little more.

1	Now I have quite a different
problem that has me perplexed like you wouldn't know.	Well, I figured out how the jumpers go.  Now I have quite a different problem that has me perplexed like you wouldn't know.  I have both drives working, the C: system formatted and all of my hardware installed.  Only problem is, that during the boot up sequence, the computer does not want to pass up looking for a system on the A: drive.  Reinitialization all goes fine and the BIOS seems to be configured to what is necessary.  All the drive tests work, but when the thing comes back around to the a: drive and there is no disk present, it just spins. If you insert a disk into drive a with a system however, it works fine and boots up (ie how installed all my software)  Any additional help on this will be most welcome....  swood

0	So, if your mouse is old, you may want to try replacing it for a newer
  one.	   I had the same problem.  At first, I thought it was the video driver and    made sure I had the most current drivers, because the problem was most   evident at SVGA resolution modes.  It didn't help and after a bit of   experimentation, determined that the problem existed in standard VGA   resolution mode. It was just much less noticeable.      My mouse was an older MS serial version I bought second hand in 1990. It   worked just fine in DOS and DOS based graphic applications.  On the    guess that the problem was with the resolution of the mouse, I borrowed   a new mouse (a MS bus model) and tried it.  That solved the problem.   So, if your mouse is old, you may want to try replacing it for a newer   one.      --  signoff
1	This
fixed the problem a friend of mine was having with his adaptec+tosh

1	How would this
number compare if I bought the state-of-the-art SCSI card for my ISA PC, and
the state-of-the-art SCSI hard drive (the wailing-est system I could hope for)?	However, I think that some people (such as myself) would benefit from answers to the simple(?) question:  Which would YOU choose, and why?  Like lots of people, I'd really like to increase my data transfer rate from the hard drive.  Right now I have a 15ms 210Mb IDE drive (Seagate 1239A), and what I would say is a standard (not special, no cache I believe) IDE controller card on my ISA 486-50.  I'm currently thinking about adding another HD, in the 300Mb to 500Mb range. And I'm thinking hard (you should hear those gears a-grinding in my head) about buying a SCSI drive (SCSI for the future benefit).  I believe I'm getting something like 890Kb/sec transfer right now (according to NU).  How would this number compare if I bought the state-of-the-art SCSI card for my ISA PC, and the state-of-the-art SCSI hard drive (the wailing-est system I could hope for)?  Obviously money factors into this choice as well as any other, but what would YOU want to use on your ISA system? And how much would it cost?  Along those lines, what kind of transfer rate could I see with my IDE HD's if I were to buy the top-of-the-line IDE caching controller for my 200Mb, 15ms HD? And how much would it cost?  I actually have a PAS-16, and could (what a waste I guess it would be...) hook up a SCSI HD through it's SCSI port which yields an optimum of 690Kb/sec. Actually, I have a borrowed 12ms Fujitsu HD hooked up through it now (and own the Trantor HD drivers for the PAS-16 SCSI port).  Is this SCSI port a SCSI-2 port?  How could I tell?  Is the Fujitsu 2623A a SCSI-2?  Are all SCSI HD's SCSI-2?  Thanks for any comments.

1	I think the extra
$10.00 is worth it just in feel.	I recently purchased a CH Flightstick.  There aren't any suction cups and no tension adjusters but otherwise it seems to be an excellent joystick.  I'm currently using it for the Wing Commander series and Red Baron.  Works quite well.  The large base does not require a steadying hand and so leaves it free.  The buttons provide good tactile response (you can hear and feel them well).  There are other models made by CH that can go up or down in features.  For price comparison Gravis analogue joysticks sell for ~$35.00 here compared to the $45.00 I paid for a CH Flightstick.  I think the extra $10.00 is worth it just in feel.  Best thing to do is to ask a salesperson to let you try them out or at least feel it before you buy.  Just another note, analogue joysticks are best for flightsims or something that needs sensitive touch.  If you're only playing games such as Castle Wolfenstein or some other game that only uses digital input (ie. only up, down, left, etc. instead of 'how much right') you might want to look into a Gravis gamepad.  They look like a Nintendo control pad but I don't know much beyond that.

1	At the SIMM 
interface, they both act as 9-bit wide 1MByte SIMMS ( 2*4+1=9*1 ).	don't believe everything you are told.  I can tell you that mixing them  between 'banks' ok, and I can't see why mixing in one bank is not unless  they are of different speeds ( e.g. mixing of 60ns and 100ns SIMMs in one  bank ).  The two only differ in the type of chips it uses.  Assuming that  the SIMMS are 1Mx9 ( 9 bit wide ), here is the two equivalent  configuration.  The 3-chip SIMM uses two 4-bit wide 4Mbit (1M of 4-bit  nibbles ) and one 1-bit wide 1Mbit chip ( for a total of 9-bit wide 1Mbyte  ).  The 9-bit SIMM uses nine 1-bit wide 1Mbit chips.  These are equivalent  because of the way that it is 'pinned' on the SIMM board.  At the SIMM  interface, they both act as 9-bit wide 1MByte SIMMS ( 2*4+1=9*1 ).  [sorry  if too techie for ya].   MG>> 	Similarly, one cannot plug in two 1MB SIMMs and one 4MB SIMMs to  gi MG>> the system a total of 6 MEG. Why is that so ?? If my system supports MG>> of 8 MEG (it has 8 SIMM slots), can I plug in 4 4MB SIMMs to give my MG>> 16MB ??  That sounds correct.  the problem is that if your computer takes 9-bit  wide SIMMs, you can not mix different sizes in one bank.  Why you ask?   Simple,  if you understand why there is banks.  Assuming you have a 32-bit  CPU ( 386DX or 486 ), the data bus (e.g. the mechanism to retrieve data  from memory ) is 32-bits wide, so the computer expects to see 32 bits when  it asks for data.  To get that bandwidth ( 32-bit wide ), the motherboard  links 4 1Mx9 ( one bit is not data, but parity, so I will ignore that in  this simple explaination ) to get 32bits [ (9-1)*4=32 bits ].  That means  that a SIMM in a bank stores only 1/4 of the 32 bit wide data.  If you  have a 16-bit bus, two 1Mx9 SIMMs are linked together to get 16-bit wide  data, which is the reason why 286 banks are 2 SIMMs wide, and 32-bit banks  are 4 SIMMs wide.  If your computer required 1Mx36 ( e.g. 32-bit wide data  with 4 parity bits, used in some PS/2s and ASTs ), you could upgrade by  one SIMM at a time.  Hope that this message is not over your head, but the answer to your  question was not simple.  I could of just said, 'because I said so.'  -rdd      ---  . WinQwk 2.0b#0 .

1	Is it the same with  
SCSI?	As I understand it, here is the process of adding such a drive.  Could you   please tell me if I'm right..  1- Buy a SCSI contoler.  Which one? I know Adaptec is good, but they are   kind of expensive.  Are there any good boards in the $100 region? I want   it to be compatible with OS2 and Unix if possible.  Also, I have seen on   the net that there are SCSI and SCSI2 drives. Is this true? Does the   adapter need to be the same as the drive? What type of drive is the   quantum?  2- connect the drive to the adapter via a SCSI cable and the power cable. Do i have to worry about the power supply? I think I have 200 watts and   all I'm powering are two floppies and the seagate drive.  3- Setup the BIOS to recognize the drive as the second drive.  What type   of drive is this? I don't have the numbers for this drive.  4- Format and create partitions on the drive. Do I use format or fdisk? I   think that IDE drives can't be low-level formatted. Is it the same with   SCSI? How exactly does fdisk work? I have a reduced msdos 5.0 manual   (clone obliges) and there is no mention of fdisk.  Ideally, I would want   the drive partitioned in to two partitions D: and E: how do I do this?  Well that seems to be all. Is there anythiing I'm forgetting?  Any help is *really* appreciated, I'm lost...  -Eric

1	I then booted 
with DRDOS 6.0 off of the floppy a second time and ran fdisk to see if 
I could access the drive.	Sorry if this has been covered before:  One of my PC illiterate friends asked me to help him install DRDOS 6.0 on his NEC Powermate SX (386SX 16).  Of course, I said "No problem" and went to work. Unfortunately, the DRDOS refuses to recognize the hard drive during  installation, even though I am still able to boot off of the hard drive using the old DOS.  After openning it up I discovered it was using an 8-bit  Seagate SCSI controller on a ST-157N SCSI 40Mbtye drive.  I then booted  with DRDOS 6.0 off of the floppy a second time and ran fdisk to see if  I could access the drive.  Lo and behold the primary 46.5 Mbyte partition  was intact (created by DOS 3.1 no less, I didn't think you could go over a 32Mbyte partition in the older DOSes. I could be wrong...).  I then tried  to remove the primary partition, which it wouldn't allow me to do.  I am  unaware of anything special that has to be done with a SCSI drive (I  kinda expected it to work just like an IDE/MFM/RLL drive for DOS  installations).  Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated (except for  "Throw it in the garbage and buy a new PC")...  Thanks in advance,

No help there. Then, not having anything better to try, I changed Normal IRQ to Delayed IRQ on the disk controller (didn't make any difference) and IOCHRDY_not_ driven to IDE_drive_controls_IOCHRDY (also had no effect).  So I put  everything back to the way it was and re-installed the cards.  I then unplugged the floppy drive cable from the disk controller.  Voila!, the PC booted from power up, although it seemed to take several seconds  before the first access to the hard disk.  Plug the floppy cable back to the controller and the original (non-boot) behavior returns.  O.K., with this additional information, does anyone in netland have any  words of wisdom for what's going on and how I should deal with it?

1	The menu system 'should' use
DOS calls to get the time, which would cause the DOS 'kernel' to do
the BIOS call, and the wrap indicator would hence be processed
properly.	There are two 'problems': (1) the BIOS TOD routine which updates the BIOS clock uses only 1 bit     for day increment, so a second wrapping of the clock past midnight     will get lost if no one calls the BIOS to read the clock in the     meantime, and (2) the BIOS resets the day wrap indicator on the first 'get date'     call from ANYBODY (after the wrap indicator has been set). So     unless the first BIOS 'get date' call after midnight is done by     the DOS 'kernel' (which is the only part of DOS which knows how to     increment the date, the day wrap indication is normally lost. My guess is that Kevin's 'menu' system uses BIOS calls to read the clock (in order to display the time), and is hence the entity which causes the day wrap indication to get lost. Even if the 'menu' system 'notices' the day 'wrap' (which I think is indicated by a non-zero value in AL), there really isn't any particularly good way to tell DOS about it, so that DOS can update the day. The menu system 'should' use DOS calls to get the time, which would cause the DOS 'kernel' to do the BIOS call, and the wrap indicator would hence be processed properly.  Possibly, though, the 'menu' system can't easily use DOS calls for time, because DOS is not reentrant, and perhaps time incrementing ofters occur while the 'menu' system is 'inside' some other DOS call.

1	It's actually
about times 1.8.	I need a cdrom drive as my order was cancelled and thought 'Why not ask the net.community'? I was ordering a Nec CDR-74 but saw so much cheaper ones that I want to know more. The drive will be used to install software and (if available) for listening to CD's. Perhaps some day I'll want to use it to read the other CD's, but that's not really relevant at the moment.  I've been offered the following CD-ROM players, for the prices stated. They all claim to have SCSI-I, and operate under OS/2. The drives are not listed in the cdrom-faq and therefor, please give your opinions on the drives, i've got the impression that they're not all SCSI. Actually the Nec was listed as non-scsi in the cdrom-faq and as a compatible SCSI product in the os2faq.  I've calculated the prices as having dutch guilders times 2. It's actually about times 1.8.

And, if it is the Rockwell chipset, what  are the chances that if I buy one of these modems (using the Rockwell chipset), that a) the bug will affect me, b) a ROM change will fix/compensate for the bug?

  	How do I set up Windows so that I can play MIDI files?    
1	Oh well, I feel better now...
		1 - Ordered a DX2/50 w/ Ultrastor 34F Local Bus HD controller 	2 - Receive system 10 days after ordering (Happy) 	3 - Discover Ultrastor 14F ISA HD Controller inside (unhappy) 	4 - Call Gateway, receive the correct controller in 5 days  		(getting happier) 	5 - New controller doesn't work (unhappy again) 	6 - Call Gateway again, get another controller in 5 more days 			(cooling off, the end is in sight) 	7 - This controller doesn't work either, motherboard is bad 		(VERY unhappy)  Gateway's solution:  They will order me a new motherboard (5 more days) 	and have on-site service install it for me. BUT, I have to take a day off of work because the service people only work 9-5 M-f.  I say, no way I've already blown about 20 hours with this, about 10 of them on hold and I don't have the time or $$ to take a day off work.  Also, my 30 day return period is almost over and I've only been able to use the thin for about 10 minutes.  So, the whole  thing is going back.     I was extremely upset when I began this post because the support rep told me that I would have to pay shipping not only for the returned system, but also the two hard drive controllers they had sent me.  Fortunately, I just spoke to customer service and they are going to have UPS come and pick everything up gratis. The only downside is that now I have to order another computer.  I would really like to try Gateway again, I'm just very turned off by the prospect of having to try and get through to Customer Service or Tech Support again...  I think their products are great for the most part, but I'm beginning to wonder if the savings are worth the potential aggravation. Are other mail order companies as difficult to contact?  I know Gateway is booming, and for good reason, but I don't know if I can take it again. Oh well, I feel better now...

1	Through trial and error, I have found that when the disrupted screen
   is displayed you should do [Alt-Spacebar] followed by the letter
   "R".	Several problems:  1) The ad specified 16.7 million colors at 640x480 resolution with 1MB    of VRAM, which is what I have. This color depth is NOT SUPPORTED    with video BIOS version 1.00 and drivers version 1.01. A max of 65K    colors are supported at 640x800 and 800x600 resolutions with 1MB    VRAM.  2) With the 65K color choice I notice two minor irritations:     a) Under NDW, when an entry in a list is highlighted (such as in an       Open menu) and then is deselected, a faint vertical line often       remains where the left edge of the highlighted rectangle used to       be.     b) With Word for Windows, when you use shading in a table, the       display shows the INVERSE of the shading; for example, if you       shade the cell as 10%, the display is 90% (the printout is OK).  3) The big killer bug is using the Borland C++ Integrated Development    Environment. The problem occurs when you click on the Turbo Debugger    icon (or use the Debugger option in the Run command), and the    debugger application goes to VGA character mode (as it is designed    to do). The screen goes haywire, and is largely unreadable. The    Turbo Debugger display is all garbled.     Through trial and error, I have found that when the disrupted screen    is displayed you should do [Alt-Spacebar] followed by the letter    "R". This instructs Turbo Debugger to refresh the screen, and it    does this satisfactorily. I wish I didn't have to do this.     The bug is more than with the Diamond drivers. The same disruptive    behavior happens with the standard VGA driver that comes with    Windows. There must be something in the video card that mishandles    the VGA mode.        The problem is not my monitor. The same bug shows up when I use    another monitor in place of my usual one.  I still like this video card, and am hoping its problems will be remedied (they do offer a 5 year warranty). 
1	No problems with either
product.
	As promised, here are the summary of opinions on DoubleDisk Gold v.6.0. People seem to be quite happy with the product. There is no much of opinion on how good it is compared to the industry leader Stacker 3.0. (Superstor Pro is not considered since it is slower than Stacker although just as reliable - BYTE Magazine's conclusion ;-) ), so it's hard to make any decision to go with Stacker or with DoubleDisk Gold v6.0.  However, it seems that at $39.95, it is quite a buy.  Buddy Christyono buddy@optics.ece.wisc.edu ------------------------------------------------------------------------- summary of replies ------------------------------------------------------------------------- Hello Buddy,  I do not have DD Gold 6.0 experience.  I just ordered it.  I currently have DD 2.3 (the last version).  I am very pleased with its performance.  Here is my suggestion...  1)  If you do not have any compression software currently, I would go with 	DOS 6.0's compression.  All the discussion on the net indicates that 	for $50 you get the compression (built into the OS), plus the other 	utilities that you would pay way more than $50 for.  Besides, you  	are now at DOS6.0 (whatever that means...)  2)  If you have DoubleDisk 2.3 already (like I do), the cost is $29.95 	for the upgrade.  After thinking about it and asking the net, I 	decided that I could not go wrong with the update cost! 	I have never suffered from performance of DD.  I have a 12ms HD with 	large SW packages in both compressed and uncompressed format.  It 	works great.  Not delays.  I think the "A" is better than "B"  	arguements are a lot of bunk... they are all comparable in performance. 	I am looking forward to being able to "LOADHIGH" the DD sw.  That 	has been an annoyance.  3)  If you have Stacker, et.al. currently, I would not see it worth the 	effort to upgrade.  Just my $.02 ...  Regards, Mark Bagdy ---------------------------------------------------------------- Buddy,  I got the same mailer. About 2 weeks ago I got DDG and installed it. The documentation was, in my opinion, easy to follow. I used the automatic installation (not the custom) and everything went smoothly.  There were some specific instructions on a readme file for dealing with 386max & QEMM. DDG has an uninstall (unlike DOS6.0) if you need it. My system has a 203Mb hard drive. before installing DDG I had ~5Mb free. After DDG I had ~197Mb free. Pretty good statistics considering that my 8Mb permanent windows swap file stayed on the uncompressed portion (along with other drivers and such).  I have had no problems whatsoever. I have noticed no slowdown (other than it takes a little longer to boot) either in windows or dos. So far I am a very happy camper.  -Bruce --    Bruce F. Steinke                    | "Never know when you're going to   bsteinke@dsd.es.com                 |  need a good piece of rope."   Software Technical Support Engineer |               Sam Gamgee   Evans & Sutherland Computer Corp.   |      <My mail, My Opinions> ---------------------------------------------------------------------------  	I have been using DoubleDisk Gold for a little more than a month on a 486DX 33Mhz, 120MB Seagate drive, running DOS & Windows in 386 enhanced mode. 	I ran some tests and concluded that the speed of a DoubleDisk drive with a drive read cache is about equal to the bare drive without a cache. 	I have no complaints about reliability.  It was very easy to install. The only problem I had was with Castle Wolfenstein 3-D.  I assumed the game was trying to bypass DOS disk access and moved the game to the non-compressed region of the disk.  Since then the game has never given me a problem.  There was never any damage to the DoubleDisk drive. 	Compression performance for the whole disk has held steady  around 1.8:1.  This is lower than expected but about 20% (size) of my files  are compressed image files and some large zip files.    If you have any more specific questions let me know. Dan ---------------------------------------------------------------------------  I bought it an have been happy with it.  I use it on both MFM and IDE 40 MB drives.  I was using DoubleDisk before Gold came out.  That is the same product MSDOS 6.0 is shipping with.  No problems with either product.

1	What is the adequate power supply?	Now I need to purchase a 486, help me to ask the right questions.  Motherboard:     I need 486-33 with 8 MB ram, with additonal slot for 8 more MB.     I would like to get two VESA Local Bus. One for video, not sure     what am I going to do with the other.      It must be able to run Unix.          What are other questions that I should ask to ensure getting a     quality stuff? What are other important features ?   Monitor:     I want a 14" non interlaced svga, but not sure about what brand     to get. I can't afford NEC or SONY. What brands should I consider?     Acer? Touch?      What else should I ask?  Video Card:      I would like to run Framemaker. So I need a fast video card. Is Western     Digital worth the $20 over Cirrus Logic?  Do I need more than 1M of      V-RAM?      One company wanted $50 more for a local bus video card. Is this normal?       Hard Drive:     Segate, Western Digital, Conner all have the same price. Which one is     more liable? which one has better performace?  Case/power supply:     Given the choise of desktop and minitower, which one is better?     What is the adequate power supply?     Is cooling a general problem or a non-issue?     What features should I ask for?      Did I miss anything?  I am sure that there are a lot of semi-PC-literates reading this group.  Your help is greatly appreciated.

0	requiring a
field to always have a value.	 Hello WinNetters:  I have seen a great deal of discussion herein on the relative merits of  MS Access and Borland Paradox/Win.  However, are there any users out there  with experience with the database package called "Approach".  It has gotten a number of very good reviews from the various mags. and it seems like it would require less hardware overhead than Paradox.  I have ruled out Access because some aspects of it are extremely non-intuitive, e.g. requiring a field to always have a value.  I like what I've seen of Paradox, but it seems like the resource requirements are greater than what I have (386/25 MHz, 6 MB ram).  So, please provide me with your thoughts are "Approach", good and bad.  Thanks.

0	Is it synchronous or asynchronous serial communication?	My current home project is to build a huge paddle keyboard for a  physically handicapped relative of mine.  My goal is for this keyboard to look exactly like an AT sytle keyboard to its host system. This will be a highly endowed keyboard with a Little PCL from Z World at its heart.  The only thing I lack is detailed information on the hardware signaling that the 486 (with  Windows 3.1  and DOS 5.0) will be  expecting.  My project is independant of Windows, my hope is that some of you fellow Window's users/programmers will recognize what I need and be  willing to point me in the right direction.   I have The Winn L. Rosch Hardware Bible (2nd edition).  The HB gives most (if not all) of the information I will need concerning scan codes  and even a wire diagram for the PS/2 style connector I will need, but it  leaves a number of important questions unanswered. 1.  Is it synchronous or asynchronous serial communication?  I'm     guessing synchronous since the host is providing a clock.  In either     event, how is the data framed? 2.  Is it half-duplex or truly one way?  I'm guessing half-duplex     since the host can turn LEDs on and off. 3.  Are there any chipsets available for communicating with the "AT     keyboard standard" (other than by cannibalizing a real keyboard)?  If anyone knows of a book or article (or any other written source of information) on the above, please advise me at gamet@erg.sri.com. Whatever I do it must be safe for I cannot afford to replace the 486 in the event of a booboo.  Thank you for your time. Danke fuer Ihre Zeit.

1	If you don't do this before fixing the alignment problem you have kissd
those files goodbye.	Too right it does!   The --VERY VERY FIRST-- thing you do is make sure that --ALL-- files on the floppies that you can currently read in the drive, which aren't already on your HD or another floppy (if you have -two- floppy drives) get copied to your HD (and/or to a floppy in your other drive).  If you don't do this before fixing the alignment problem you have kissd those files goodbye.  (Well, you can -try- to re-misalign the drive back to read your floppies, but don't count on be able to do so!)  Generally, head alignment is something I'd only trust to a good repair shop (though there are/have been DIY guides).

0	A lot of them have been in user.exe or  
gdi.exe.	Some background:  I have a Leading Edge 486sx25 with Phoenix BIOS.  When I   first got it it had 4Mg of memory.  It ran windows fine (not too many   GPF's).  Then, a couple of weekends ago, I installed Lotus 123 for windows   (with ATM), a game card and an additional 4  1Mg SIMMS.  The Leading edge   machine is kind of strange, in that it has the IDE controler built into   the motherboard, the CPU is actually on a sparate board that plugs into   the motherboard and the SIMMS it uses are Macintosh SIMMS! Apparently I   was told that the Leading Edge had the parity bit built into the mother   board.  The original 4Mg 80ns SIMMS where of the 2 chip variety from   SAMSUNG, and the ones I installed are 8 chip SIMMS. They are recognized   fine by the BIOS RAM check. The game card is a generic $20 gamecard.  The reason why I mention the hardware like this is that sometimes   rebooting the machine using the reset button or ctl-alt-del still leaves   the machine kind of flaky, but turning it on and off doesn't.   I haven't tried taking out the RAM or the game card, because as I said   these GPF are not reproducible at will.  I have gone through and entire   day using the computer with no problems and then I might get 5 or so GPF's   in the sppace of 20 minutes?  What can I do.  This situation is most annoying... Are there any good   diagnostic tools for hardware? Do you think that this might be a software   problem (ie EMM386 etc.)? If it helps, i have manage to get GPF's on After   Dark, quicken, Paint shop pro. A lot of them have been in user.exe or   gdi.exe.  Any help is truly appreciated.....  -Eric

I've got unix loaded on one of my pcs (along with windogs) and the OS can only use one of the two IDE drives at one time.  It's pretty ugly.  I just bought at Quantum 240 for my mac at home.  I paid $369 for it.  I haven't seen IDE drives cheaper.  : The original CGA cart back in '84 was $300.  I think the original EGA card : (or PGA?) was $800.  SCSI has stood relatively alone in not coming down : in price, mainly because we're talking about PC's and not Sun's or Sparc : or SGI or (name your favorite unix workstation).  That is, after millions : of PC buying decisions over the years, SCSI has had plenty of time to : come down in price.  No, actually, we're talking about SCSI being expensive simply because nobody did a common interface for the PC.  If they had a common (read: easily implemented) method of adding scsi to a PC (like as in a Sun or Mac), then you'd find SCSI the connection medium of choice.  : I won't argue that the SCSI standard makes for a good, well implimented : data highway, but I still want to know why it intrinsically better : (than IDE, on an ISA bus) when it comes to multi-tasking OS's when : managing data from a single SCSI hard drive.  On a single drive, SCSI is more expensive.  But, you bought your PC for expandibility, so, you'd want to add more drives or whatever.  The following are why I find SCSI intrinsically better than IDE:  A (partial?) list: 	1.  You can add many different types of devices and access them  	concurrently. 	2.  A SCSI device works on many different machines (I have a mac 	and a PC at home and moving hard drives between them is VERY nice 	with SCSI -- hook them up and away they go) 	3.  SCSI devices work together better than IDE devices.  For 	instance, recently, I added an older connor 100 meg IDE to a maxtor 	212 meg IDE.  The connor *MUST* be setup as the slave.  It will 	work no other way.  On SCSI, you set the address, check the 	termination, plug it in, and away it goes. 	4.  I have a problem with IDE's mutual exclusion - I notice that 	the time it takes to switch from accessing drive c: to drive d: is 	quite long as compared to the time it takes to switch from drive c: 	to d: on a SCSI system.  Under a multitasking OS, this is very 	noticable, as many things can be going on at once.  One neat thing that I've noticed lately (a fringe benefit) has been the ability to add older (almost dead) drives as storage on a SCSI system with little problem -- we've got a bunch of almost dead 20 meg drives that I've added to my PC.  I've now got the interface full, but, it does allow me to have 4 20 meg drives, 1 240 meg drive, 1 tape drive, and 1 105 meg drive all on the same card.    Simply put, SCSI is handier than IDE.  No mysterious jumpers to figure out.  Greg.

Access is a new RDBMS for the Windows Operating System.	The discussion period started on April 6 and it will last until April 28, ( 22 days ).  This is an official RFD for the creation of a new newsgroup for the general discussion of the Microsoft Access RDMS.  NAME: COMP.DATABASES.MS-ACCESS  MODERATION: UNMODERATED. At this time, no need for a moderator has been assertained. Future evaluation will determine if one is needed.  PURPOSE:  Access is a new RDBMS for the Windows Operating System. It includes WYSIWYG design tools for easy creation of tables, reports, forms and queries and a database programming language called Access Basic. THe purpose of the group will be to provide help to people who use Access's  WYSIWYG design tools to create simple databases as well as to people who use  Access Basic to create complex databases.  RATIONALE: Eventhough Access is a new RDBMS, it is very popular because of its Graphical Development enviroment and its initial low price. Been a version 1.0 product means that all Access users are Novices. For that reason a newsgroup is needed where Access users can discuss  their experiences with the product and answer each other's questions.
1	Thanks,

Koji	I'm seriously considering buying the Insight Talon TA-2000 MM Kit, which is bundled with the CD-ROM drive with 265-280ms access time, 300Kb dtr, multispin, multi-session Photo CD capability, etc., and with the PAS-16 sound card, etc.... (if you are familiar with Insight, you know the kit I mean).  I believe the drive is either a Texel (265ms) or an NEC (280ms), but it is not clear to me which one is actually a part of the bundle (at least two of their sales people couldn't give me a straight answer as to which one; ah, yes, one of the drawbacks of OEM!).  Other questions:  - Excuse my ignorance, but is "Texel" a reputable maker in the CD-ROM   market?  Or do you think NEC is the better drive?  - Bottom line:  Is this kit worth the money?  (Currently, $449 for the   TA-1000, and $699 for the TA-2000)  Alternatively, I was thinking that the TA-2000 might be overkill for my uses (however, I *do* want full multimedia capabilities, Photo CD stuff, educational programs for my kids, etc.), and considered the lower-end TA-1000 kit and using the difference (around $250.00) to get something else useful, like a tape back-up drive unit.  Basically, I would just like to hear from those who have actually USED these kits, and whatever pros/cons you might advise, preferably directly to the email address below.  Thanks,  Koji

it to you.	If you need just to change the wallpaper, then I've written a short program in VB that does this by using SystemParametersInfo-function. The bad news is that you need VBRUN200.DLL to run it, and the DLL is some 350kb (the program is about 7kb). The order of pictures depends on the system date and the number of BMP-files in the directory, so the picture remains the same if you execute the program multiple times during the same day and the number of BMPs has not changed.  If you feel this is what you need then I could uuencode it and email it to you. (It is unavailable via ftp.)

1	Make sure the card is operating in synchronus mode which is 2x faster.	    1. Dont rely on benchmarks. They often show incorrect due to different    TSR programs.  2. SCSI often needs a driver to get the speed from the card.  3. Make sure the card is operating in synchronus mode which is 2x faster.  4. You can disable disconnect and get some kB/s but just to loose the mouse    or other int`s when diskaccesing.

I caled micron because this seemed pathetically slow and they said that norton 6.xx doesn't recognize local bus and won't give accurate results.  I was told I would need norton 7.0 in order to get a true account of my ide transfer speed.  I didn't really like this answer in part because the drive doesn't seem as though it's cranking along at much more than that, but I also don't know if I could tell the difference.  I tried playing around with settings in the CMOS (bus speed at the like) and noticed no significant change in performance.  **B0100000027fed4 Frank Shea 
0	Instead, use router=<Name of your Router>, as specified in your QVTHOST.RC
I know the release notes for 3.31 say that IP addresses should work also,
but  apparently they don't.	 They are working ok, but your definitions in QVTNET.INI and QVTHOST.RC are incorrect (see below).   No, I don't think so. You are using QVTNET and NOVELL concurrently, aren't you? They use different packet types, so QVTNET (TCP/IP) and NOVELL (IPX/SPX) should be able to coexist just fine. PKTMUX is required if you are using different TCP/IP-Packages concurrently.   There is the first problem: You didn't specify hostnames, just IP-Addresses. Your file should look like this:  137.112.5.2        <Name of your Nameserver> 137.112.199.50     <Name of your Router>   Here you should only specify your hostname, without the domain part.   Instead, use router=<Name of your Router>, as specified in your QVTHOST.RC I know the release notes for 3.31 say that IP addresses should work also, but  apparently they don't.   Here, too, you should use the hostname of the nameserver instead of the IP address.  It worked fine for me that way, although I could not specify more than one nameserver. The relnotes say it should be possible to specify up to three nameservers, separated by commas, but it didn't work.  Hope it helps, Richard

0	If you pop out to DOS and exit back to Windows - the
screen gets refreshed again.	I am thinking that my problem is with the way Windows refreshes it's screen.  The problem is that once Windows has been envoked, the colors start changing themselves.  At first I thought it was hardware, but if you open a full screen DOS program from within the Windows session, you don't have any problems until you get back to Windows - however, when you initially return to Windows, the original colors get refreshed properly.  Also, it is not a uniform color change - so if you are in solitaire, the design on the back of the card maintains it's original color scheme, but the white fronts of the cards will turn grey, then blue, etc.  The color changes keep getting darker until finally everything is a dark purple-ish black.  If you pop out to DOS and exit back to Windows - the screen gets refreshed again.  If I don't log into Windows and just do DOS things from the Novell network, everything is fine.  I originally loaded the software by bouncing it down to the net from the other machine I had just finished configuring, then from the net to this machine.  When I ran into problems, I deleted everything on this machine and the net, and tried bouncing it again.  When that didn't work, I tried reloading Windows to no avail.  Any thoughts on things to check out?  I am totally baffled!  Thanks in advance for any assistance and instruction!

Remember I'm using a 32 bit OS, and alot of Floating Point operations.  2) How much faster would a 486DX-33 be than the 386DX-40+copro ?

I dont know how to get there from here. The local bus interface got me a little, but certainly not as much as I had hoped. I am also looking for a way to  improve my disk performance, but Im not convinced that the controller is the bottleneck (although Im willing to entertain the possibility that it is).

you get a nice little flashing cursor in the top left corner of your

Also, sometimes when you exit to DOS, the same effect occurs. Cringely hints that Microsoft and/or Novell has a patch for Windows' virtual interrupt controller that  may solve this.  Neither company seems to know what I am talking about when I call them.  Has anyone else noticed this phenomenon?    Is there a fix for it?  Any response is welcome.

0	P.S.	AT any rate, the Actix graphics engine ultra outperforms all the other cards in the 928 class (based on the winmark results).  If you are looking for the all around best dos/windows performance  check out the actix card. Their 1-800 number is 927-5557.  P.S. The article in pc magazine noted that if you are a regular dos user (ie: games) then you should also check out the 801 chip from s3. It apparently scores just as well and in many cases slightly better in dos than the 928 chip (ie: stealth and actix cards.) They have "comparable" windows performance and are cheaper to buy.
0	It's
GREAT at converting files of all types, including Mac, NExT, Sun, and
various PC formats...		THe best sound conversion program I've ever seen is SoundTool, which is shareware from Germany.  I found a copy somewhere in wuarchive.wustl.edu a long time ago, but I don't know offhand what directory it was under.  It's GREAT at converting files of all types, including Mac, NExT, Sun, and various PC formats... It's also a great player and editor, with various special effects that put Windows' Sound Recorder to shame.  It requires a driver for various sound cards... The only builtin one is for the pc speaker (and even that sounds pretty good), but if you're just using it to convert things, you can convert them in SoundTool and then play them in Sound Recorder.  Give it a try!  Bret

0	- this is what I *heard* - the
Alpha still kicks in the P5's butt in fp - again, this is what I *heard*).	Anyway, to respond, I think the Pentium (CISC) is better than the more advanced RISC (e.g., like the alpha, etc.  the 66MHz Pentium has approximately the same "performance" as the superduper 133MHz Alpha - here, performance is the weird Specint92 that everyone refers to? - this is what I *heard* - the Alpha still kicks in the P5's butt in fp - again, this is what I *heard*). and in the computing world, if you sell lots of chips (like intel), and make it faster (like intel), you are the winner (like intel), even though you have a sucky architecture from over 10 years ago (like intel :0).  If you can make a "CISC" chip (superscalar, superduperpipelined, superfast) with the ideas behind the "RISC" ideology, you got a CISC chip.  And then I admit I can't see the advantages of RISC over CISC...  If the latest technology is a generation behind, then it sucks (relatively speaking).  Now I may sound like I like intel, but I'll have to say that the P5 is some real kick butt pile of Si and SiO2...  But I hope that Motorola really catches up with the 68K line... or I'm gonna start crying...  brian  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Brian "Hojo" Lee       | "Hey, excuse me miss, could I have a .GIF of you?" leebr@ecf.toronto.edu  | leebr@eecg.toronto.edu | (try Linux... the best and free UN*X clone!)

0	Is there a noticeable print quality difference,
particularly in graphics?	I am asking for your collected wisdom to help me decide which printer I should purchase, the Canon BJ200 (BubbleJet) vs. the HP DeskJet 500.  I thought, rather than trust the salesperson, I would benefit more from relying on those who use these printers daily and use them to their fullest potential.  And, I figure all of you will know their benefits and pitfalls better than any salesperson.  Now, I would greatly appreciate any information you could render on the 360 dpi of the Canon BubbleJet vs. the Hewlett-Packard DeskJet 500 (300 dpi). Which is faster?  Is there a noticeable print quality difference, particularly in graphics?  Which will handle large documents better (75 pages or more) -- any personal experience on either will be appreciated here?  Which works better under Windows 3.1 (any driver problems, etc)? Cost of memory, font packages, toner cartridges, etc?  Basically, your personal experiences with either of these machines is highly desirable, both good and bad.  Advance kudos and thanks for all your input.  E-mail or news posting is readily acceptable, but e-mail is encouraged (limits bandwidth).  -- Sincerely,  Robert Kayman	----	kayman@cs.stanford.edu  -or-  cpa@cs.stanford.edu

0	So the moral of the story is use only SPACE characters
to align equation frames.	    I contacted Lotus about this problem today.  It has been reported previously and there is a fix.  Apparantly the problem only occurs when TAB characters are used immediately preceding the equation frame.  The work around when equations are expected to touch the right margin is to delete at least one preceding TAB and use SPACE to align the frame (or use set frame where placed w/no text wrap around).  Unforutnately, once the page run-on has occured you are hosed. So the moral of the story is use only SPACE characters to align equation frames.  Hope this helps the rest of you who have already contacted me with this  problem.

1	Unfortunately I
have located only one of them (in the lower front corner).	I have recently suffered from various problems concerning an Adaptec 1542A controller.  Problem 1: Floppy disk drive doesn't work. There's apparently at least two jumpers on the controller that affect the floppy disk drive. Unfortunately I have located only one of them (in the lower front corner). I would like to know, if there are any other such jumpers and possibly where they  are located.  Problem 2: My hard disks refuse to boot. With my two SCSI HD's (Rodime, Miniscribe) I get a message 'Missing operating system', even though the disks have been formatted with the same controller and they damn sure have an operating system on them. If I boot from a Quantum I might get as far as getting the MS-DOS version information. This might of course be due to incombatible memory drivers. Are there any jumpers that could affect the HD causing such errors?  	Thanks in advance          Jouni

0	You can think of these as a sheet of lined
notebook paper, a sheet of graph paper, and a stack of 3X5 cards.	 You'll probably want to delete any damaged executables and reload them fresh.  Data files should be examined and repaired.   You're not stupid.  Smartdrive caches things, and Windows also runs a swap file which may contain data also.  All of this is pretty risky stuff in a PC environment.   A reasonably accurate prediction...   Here's a brief description of how DOS stores files:  There are three pieces to a file.  The directory entry, the FAT chain, and the data area.  You can think of these as a sheet of lined notebook paper, a sheet of graph paper, and a stack of 3X5 cards.  The directory entry (notebook paper) holds the file name, actual size, and first cluster number.  It also holds some other information that's not important right now.  The File Allocation Table (FAT) chain (graph paper) tells where to find the actual data.  Each square of graph paper holds a number.  If the number is zero, the cluster associated with this box is available.  If it holds a "magic" number, it is either the last piece of a file or a bad (unuseable) spot on the disk.  Any other number tells which cluster contains the next section of the file.  The data area (3X5 cards) is where the actual information is stored. The data area is organized as clusters of a fixed size; storage is doled out in "chunks" of one cluster each.  (In your case, one cluster is 2048 bytes.)  As a cluster is filled, another is allocated.  To read a file, you first look at the directory entry to get the starting cluster number.  Now you read the data from that cluster. Next, look at the FAT entry for the cluster you just read.  This will tell you the cluster number for the next chunk of the file. Naturally, these numbers are usually sequential, but they can jump around and even go backwards.  Continue reading, one cluster at a time, as you walk this chain through the FAT, until you hit the marker which says it's the last cluster in the file.  CHKDSK is the DOS utility that checks the sanity and coherence of the directories and the FAT and can bludgeon most flaws into submission.  It doesn't have any intelligence, so you have to double-check anything it "fixes".  Now let's do a bit of a post-mortem:   All of these files have sizes (according to the FAT) which don't match the size reported in their directory entries.  CHKDSK /F will alter the directory entries to match the FAT size.  (In other words,   the directory entry for CVPIC.EXE may say the file is 64,877 bytes long. But CHKDSK found a FAT chain of 43 clusters attached to it.  (My numbers, obviously, are made up.))   Disk space was found which is allocated in the FAT, but is not attached to any directory entry.  CHKDSK /F gives you the option of converting these "lost chains" to files.  You can then examine the files (FILE0000.CHK through FILE0223.CHK) and rename or discard them.  Or, if you tell CHKDSK _not_ to convert them to files, then those clusters will simply be marked "available" in the FAT.    ...   These files are both referencing the _same_ data cluster.  Obviously, one of them (at least) must be wrong.  It's interesting to note that C:\386SPART.PAR is your Windows swap file...  To fix this, you should copy each cross-linked file to a new name. This will "fix" the cross-link by giving the files unique data spaces. Now delete the cross-linked files.  Examine the copies and try to assemble them properly.  Good luck.  (Hint:  "Missing pieces" are likely to be found in those "lost chains" at the top...)   Your disk is pretty close to full.  This may be the actual cause of the problem; perhaps Windows needed to expand its swapfile by an amount which exceeded available disk space...  In any case, the short summary is that something trashed your FAT. There are utilities that can mirror your FAT and help repair damage after something like this, but you have to run them _before_ the problem occurs.  Sorry.   --  ---------------------------------------------------- Gordon S. Hlavenka           cgordon@vpnet.chi.il.us Vote straight ticket Procrastination party Dec. 3rd! --

tubes from Sony.	Good luck finding an MX17S.  When I was looking around back in December/January, Mag wasn't producing any because they couldn't get tubes from Sony.  I asked when they expected to restart production as I was willing to wait a few months to get an MX17S but they said not any time soon.  I wound up getting a T560i and am extremely happy with it.

With any luck PC bus archeitecture will be doen any with by sbus.  Have you ever seen what happens when you hook a busmaster controller to a vesa local bus.  It actually  slows down your system  Maybe my workstation doesn't understand what your vesa local bus IDE is  Vesa local bus will be killed off by pcmi? whatever intels spec is. VLBUS it not good for much more than vga cards.  To each his own.  I'll laugh when you start crying over how much you spent for your 2 little ide drives and then finding out you need more space.  Here Here....    don't stick your foot in your mouth when you make a statement you know nothing about.   I'd rather wait a second compared to the 5 minutes and ide would take. (obviously exaggerated).  Have you ever tried to backup 2 gigs of disk?  Oh I forgot you can't because you have an ide and no one makes ide disks that big.   I guess you probably bought a 486sx too   What?  The SCSI-2 FAST,WIDE spec has much more bandwidth than any stupid vlbus ide crap....  Stop this thread now, Its just cluttering up bandwidth.  If you want to read about scsi vs ide just pay a visit to you local usenet archive.  the best SCSI-2 FAST,WIDE,etc is clearly faster than any the best ide drive. All the response given are based upon personal experience with 1 or 2 drives.  You can't judge such completely different interfaces.   IDE has the low cost adavantage + a descent performance. SCSI has the ability for super high capacity expandibility and speed.  neither one is better in all cases.  If you don't belive what I said about busmastering and vlbus then pick up a back issue of PC-week in whihc they tested vlbus, eisa and isa busmastering cards.  send flames to /dev/null.....

0	Why is it that I find the Mac desktop incredibly annoying whenever I
use it?	This is silly. Is Unix a mature OS? Depends on who you ask, and how you define mature. System 7 is, if anything, less mature than Windows 3.1.    So why do you need something like BeHierarchic to create groups under the Apple Menu? Everyone knows that Apple Menu Items are a ripoff of the Program Manager. If you want a hierarchic program launcher there are lots available.   And this is easy on a Mac? Give me a break. Having spent hours moving System Extensions around and restarting the Mac to see why a certain app crashes all the time, I find this laughable.   Oh great. Ever hear of aliases? Wonder why Apple implemented them.   Eh?? I don't follow.   Why is it that I find the Mac desktop incredibly annoying whenever I use it?    Yeah right.

1	when I insert a disk,
but I can't access it.	I already tried our national news group without success.  I tried to replace a friend's original IBM floppy disk in his PS/1-PC with a normal TEAC drive. I already identified the power supply on pins 3 (5V) and 6 (12V), shorted pin 6 (5.25"/3.5" switch) and inserted pullup resistors (2K2) on pins 8, 26, 28, 30, and 34. The computer doesn't complain about a missing FD, but the FD's light stays on all the time. The drive spins up o.k. when I insert a disk, but I can't access it. The TEAC works fine in a normal PC.  Are there any points I missed?  Thank you. 	Volkmar 
1	As expected this is VERY
 expencive.	SCSI is not complex. It is just the way the industry uses and talks about it. There are THREE key differences in SCSI; the controller chip, the port, and the software.  THAT IS IT. Let us look as SCSi in from THIS stand point.  SCSI-1: asynchronous and synchronous modes {SOFTWARE SCSI DRIVER ONLY}  asynchronous is slower then synchronous mode {only 0-3MB/s vs. 0-5MB/s}  synchronous speeds can be reached by most SCSi-1 divices with a  rewrite of the software driver {As is the case for the Mac Quadra.}  SCSI-2 {8-bit}: THIS is the main source for the confusion. This differs from  SCSI-1 ONLY in the controler chip in most machines.  In the Mac and some PCs  this is called 'fast SCSI-1' because it uses SCSI-1 ports and software drivers  AND can produce SCSI-2 SPEEDS through SCSI-1 INSPITE of this even in the   slower asynchronous mode.  Average speed in asynchronous SCSi-1 mode   4-6MB/s with 8MB/s{See in both Quadras and higher end PCs} Synchronous  mode just allows a higher burst rate {10/MB/s}  SCSI-2 {16-bit}: TWO versions-Wide/Fast.  Wide SCSI-2 requires TWO things  over 8-bit SCSI-2:  a SCSI-2 software driver and a wide SCSI port on the  machine and the external device.  Fast SCSI-2 also requires TWO things over 8-bit SCSI-2: SCSI-2 driver  software and that the RECIEVING devise support 16-bit fast SCSI-2.  Speed of both is the same: 8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst.  SCSI-2 {32-bit}:  Also know as Wide AND Fast SCSI.  Over 8-bit SCSI-2 this  requires: SCSI-2 driver software, wide SCSI-2 port, and that the RECIEVING  devices ALSO have a 32-bit mode SCSI-2 chip.  As expected this is VERY  expencive.  Speed: 15-20MB/s with 40MB/s bursts

I struggled with the margin problem for ages as well, until I finally got hold of the shareware binary editor BEAV133, and dug into NOTEPAD.EXE (there is no SETUP facility to force NOTEPAD to default to  0.0 margins- it's hardwired into code!!!).   	Do a SEARCH for ".75", then change the offending bytes to ".00",  et viola. Who are the guys who hardcode these "options" anyway?

Anyway, substitute whatever .RLE file you want.  The win.cnf has the  info needed to start Windows (think of it as a bootstrap) and vgalogo.vga has  video information.

1	SCSI has stood relatively alone in not coming down
in price, mainly because we're talking about PC's and not Sun's or Sparc
or SGI or (name your favorite unix workstation).	Why don't you start with the spec-sheet of the ISA bus first? You can quote SCSI specs till you're blue in the face, but if they exceed the ISA bus capability, then what's the point?  Who says IDE is limited to 5 megs/sec?  What about VLB-IDE?  Does anyone know how they perform?   As implimented on what system?     Given the original question (SCSI used only as a single hard drive controller),  is it then necessary to get a SCSI drive that will do at least 5, maybe 10 megs/sec for the SCSI choice to make any sence? What does a 200-400 meg 5 megs/sec SCSI drive cost?   The original CGA cart back in '84 was $300.  I think the original EGA card (or PGA?) was $800.  SCSI has stood relatively alone in not coming down in price, mainly because we're talking about PC's and not Sun's or Sparc or SGI or (name your favorite unix workstation).  That is, after millions of PC buying decisions over the years, SCSI has had plenty of time to come down in price.
0	To date, Microsoft has shipped over
	50,000 beta copies and pre-release SDKs of Windows NT -- the
	actual release is slated for May/June '93.	NAME: 	 comp.os.ms-windows.nt.setup STATUS:  Unmoderated. PURPOSE: Discussions about setting up and installing Windows NT, and about 	 system and peripheral compatability issues for Windows NT.  NAME:	 comp.os.ms-windows.nt.misc STATUS:	 Unmoderated. PURPOSE: Miscellaneous non-programming discussions about using Windows NT, 	 including issues such as security, networking features, console 	 mode and Windows 3.1 (Win16) compatability.  RATIONALE: 	Microsoft NT is the newest member of the Microsoft Windows family 	of operating systems (or operating environments for those who wish 	to argue about the meaning of an "OS").  The family ranges from 	Modular Windows through Windows 3.1 and Windows for Workgroups to 	Windows NT at the high end.  To date, Microsoft has shipped over 	50,000 beta copies and pre-release SDKs of Windows NT -- the 	actual release is slated for May/June '93.  	While Windows NT has an entirely new design internally, it shares 	an application programming interface with the other members of the 	Windows family; its Win32 API includes the Win16 API used in Win- 	dows 3.1, and the Win32s API subset (Win32 less threads, networking 	and security) can be used to create 32-bit applications for 	Windows 3.1.  	The user interface is also practically identical to that of Windows 	3.1, with the addition of logins and a few other features.  It uses 	Program Manager, File Manager and other applets, and generally pre- 	sents an identical appearance to the user.  Many of the announced 	Windows NT applications are ports of existing Windows 3.1 apps, and 	NT also runs existing 3.1 applications.  	Thus, it appears logical that Windows NT should share the following 	groups with the other members of the Windows family: 		comp.os.ms-windows.apps 		comp.os.ms-windows.programmer.tools 		comp.os.ms-windows.programmer.misc 		comp.os.ms-windows.programmer.win32 	 	The following groups are also clearly applicable to Windows NT as 	well as Windows 3.1: 		comp.os.ms-windows.announce 		comp.os.ms-windows.advocacy 	 	In conclusion, the only clear argument for the separation of the 	Windows 3.1 and Windows NT hierarchies is different internal 	structures of Windows 3.1 and Windows NT.  And yet operating 	systems such as OS/2, Macintosh OS, Xenix and Coherent all have 	undergone major rewrites without having been split into separate 	newsgroup hierarchies.  	Further, Windows 3.1 is due for a major rewrite itself in 1994 -- 	when the fully 32-bit, protected-mode and with-DOS-built-in next- 	generation Windows, "Chicago", debuts next year, surely it should 	remain in the same hierarchy.  And what, then, would be the jus- 	tification for separating Windows NT from other Windows versions?   DISCUSSION PERIOD: 	The discussion period will run from 27 April, 1992 to 18 May, 1993.    VOTING: 	The CFV (Call for Votes) will be issued around 19 May, 1993, based on 	the feedback received during the discussion period.  No votes will 	be accepted prior to the CFV.

However, given that I don't have direct Internet access - which means I don't have Archie access - I must resort to using FTPMAIL.

hypos for injecting ink into the cartridges.	I was at the Trenton Computer Fest and there were many sources of ink refills for the HP and Canon, so if you don't like the ink you're using, you have a choice.  There is a Frequently Asked Question (FAQ) list that's reposted occasionally that reports how to refill the cartridges yourself with inks that are available from the stationery store instead of a "specialty" ink with the specialty price.  I'm not sure, but I think I found another legal source of cheap hypos for injecting ink into the cartridges. More on that when my mail order succeeds. --  Jeffrey Jonas

REG.DAT).	Unfortunately there is still a "ghost" of SPSS left: when I run something like "Write" and go to embed an object then "SPSS Chart" appears on the list of objects I'm offered. I looked around all the obvious "INI" files without success. The next thing I tried was looking for the string "SPSS Chart" in every file in the  Windows directory. It turned up in a file called REQ.DAT (or REG.DAT). Unfortunately the file was binary and so I didn't feel inclined to edit it.  I'd welcome a solution for removing SPSS from the list of OLE servers.

0	The new UART's (16550) can
       buffer 16, which should be plenty for most situations.	Try the following:    1) Turn off disk write cache for the disk you are downloading to.  The        cache will save up so much that when it grabs control of the machine        it takes too long to write to disk and you loose characters.     2) Use a different UART for your serial line.  The old UART's (8250 or 16450)        can only buffer one character internally.  The new UART's (16550) can        buffer 16, which should be plenty for most situations.  You can run        \windows\msd.exe to find out what UART is on the machine.
0	Also, it would change brightness 
when I switched modes and I was constantly having to fiddle with the 
controls.	There was nothing really broken with the Viewsonic but overall it did not  match up.  I used my ATI Graphics Ultra in setup mode to push the  frequencies to their limits and the Viewsonic exhibited some problems that  the NEC did not.  I personally like the non-etched NEC with the OCLI filter  and the tube on the 17 was not as nice.  The 17 had some uncorrectable  pincusion and edge distortion problems.  Also, it would change brightness  when I switched modes and I was constantly having to fiddle with the  controls.  And the yoke was crooked and I had no way to compensate for the  raster that tilted downhill.  On the postive side, although not as handsome  as the NEC, the 17 had a smaller footprint and was not as heavy.  I have heard that Panasonic owns Viewsonic and the model 17 is being sold  through OEM channels with a Panasonic label on it.  If it's available that  way at a lower cost I could get more serious about it.  For now the NEC has  my vote but I'm searching for one of the new, cheaper, NEC 5FGe's to see if  it's just as good as its older brother the 5FG before I decide which one to  buy.  I have no experience with the Nanao.  I can never keep the Nanao models  straight and don't have any place I can walk in to get a good comparison of  all models.  --   Standard employer disclaimers apply   
0	The way I eventually managed to update a database was by
sending key-
   strokes from VB to Access using the SendKeys command.	1) There seems to be a limit of 255 characters for a DDE Topic string. Is this inherent in all DDE systems or just peculiar to MSACCESS or VB?  2) It is easy to query an Access database from VB using the DDE SQL command, (provided the above limitation is overcome by using short field and table names) but how is one meant to update a database?    a) A DDE SQL UPDATE command does not seem to work.    b) Initiating an Access macro using a DDE Execute command from VB cannot       be used because when the macro requests information from VB using a       second DDE channel the programs dead lock until time- outs occur.       (The VB to Access channel has to close before the Access to VB channel       is initiated, I guess.)    c) Access does not allow VB to DDE POKE the information.      The way I eventually managed to update a database was by sending key-    strokes from VB to Access using the SendKeys command. This technique has    the problem that Access cannot be minimised and it must always be in a    state ready to respond to the sequence of key-strokes VB sends.  Are all the above statements correct or have I made incorrect assumptions? Are there any better work arounds to the above? Are there any signs of an ODBC driver for Access?

If you consider the fact that NT has:  the Lanman redirectors,  built in support for TCP/IP  built in support for NETBEUI  comes with TCP utils like ping and an ftp client, etc  applications like schedule+ and a 32 bit version of msmail  the storage argument isnt an issue.   I ran it on a 486 with 8MRAM and it did a ton of disk swapping, with a 19M virtual memory paging file.  It functioned but it crawled.  (this was the OCT build)  I upgraded the machine to 16M and the performance is good, At that point I installed the March Build.  Consider they are probably still working on the feature set, and havent done a lot of fine tuning to the code yet.   I have little info on Chicago so I cant make a comparison.  Is it in Beta?  Is there anyone out there who has tested both and cares to make a comparison? Just my $0.02

1)  Is there an easy way to restore everything to working order?	While running the MS Quick C compiler in a DOS window under Windows 3.1  this evening, I got a "program has violated system integrity... close all  applications, exit windows and restart your computer" error.  I started to do this when I immediately got a "Serious disk error" message from Windows.  "hit return to retry".  I did that about 5 times and then rebooted to find that quite a few files have been corrupted somehow. (I am including the chkdsk output below.)  Questions:  1)  Is there an easy way to restore everything to working order? What might be some better approaches?  2)  What might have caused this?  Does the SMARTDRV cache make me more vulnerable?  (I'm suspicious of hard drive caches especially when they cache data writing.)  The straightforward approach would be to run chkdsk with the /f option to  fix the disk and then it looks like I would probably have to reinstall Windows and a few other things.  Thanks for your comments and suggestions.

Have you tried re-creating it by either 1.exiting filemanager with the save setting option on when the status bar is visible, or 2.double clicking on the Control menu(the one with minimize and maximize in in) when everything looks proper?  If you have, and it still doesn't work, you may want to delete your winfile.ini and try one of these two saving procedures again to totally recreate the file from scratch.  Good luck!

roking@lynx.dac.northeastern.edu	Could some kind sole email me the specs for a Western Digital drive?  It is Model # WD93044-A with 782 cyl and 4 hds.  But I do not know the sectors per track, or any of the other information I have to feed to my bios to get it up and running.  Thanx for any help Bob K.  roking@lynx.dac.northeastern.edu
1	Use at own risk.	From a recent BYTE magazine i got the following:  [Question and part of the answer deleted]    If you are handy with a soldering iron, the loopback plugs are easy to make.  On a serial RS-232 nine-pin port, use a female DB-9 connector and connect pins 1 to 7 to 8; 2 to 3; and 4 to 6 to 9.  For serial RS-232  25-pin ports, you'll need a female DB-25 connector with pins 1 to 7; 2 to 3; 4 to 5 to 8; 6 to 11 to 20 to 22; 15 to 17 to 23; and 18 to 25 connected.  To test a Centronics 25-pin parallel port, you'll need to connect pins 1 to 13; 2 to 15; 10 to 16; 11 to 17; and 12 to 14 in a male DB-25 connector.  					-Stan Wszola ---  I haven't tried it. Use at own risk.
1	Your mileage may vary.	This is from reading my motherboard manual, and these are my interpre- tations.  Your mileage may vary.  Strictly speaking, VL and 50mhz are not compatable.  And, there is at least one 'fudge' mechanism to physically allow it to work. 
1	And we are talking ISA bus, or possibly EISA or VLB.	 Why the spec list again?  We are talking SCSI on a PC, not on a MAC or a UNIX box.  And we are talking ISA bus, or possibly EISA or VLB.  This isin't comp.periphs.SCSI. Tell me what the performance figures are with a single SCSI drive on a PC with an ISA (or EISA or VLB) bus.  Theoretical performance figures are not relevant to this group or this debate.  I'm sure that there are some platforms out there that can handle the 40 megs/sec of SCSI xyz wide'n'fast, but the PC isin't one of them.

0	With level 2 many issues have been refined but the Red Book does
	leave big, big holes in the implementation specific stuff.	Q:	Which version of Adobe PS will we clone? 	Aside from the level 1 and level 2 issues, Adobe has in the past released 	new code that incorporates modifications/upgrades/fixes just as all other 	software vendors do. The level 2 stuff may seem sound now, but I assure 	you,changes will become more frequent as their customer list begins to 	dwindle in the face of competition. This allows them to shift people to 	maintenance, as well as design efforts for level 3.  Q:	Do we duplicate the bugs, or do we make it work correctly? 	From the LaserWriter to the LaserJet 4 there have been bugs. (If I had 	a number to call at HP or Adobe, they'ld have heard from me.) Deciding 	which approach to take depends on which printer you want to emulate.  Q:	Do we follow the Red Book, or do we follow someone's implementation? 	Without a doubt, there are differences between the Red Book and Adobe's 	PS. With level 2 many issues have been refined but the Red Book does 	leave big, big holes in the implementation specific stuff. It would be 	nice it the Red Bood at least pined things down enough so that two 	different implementations of Adobe's PS don't do the exact opposite given 	an identical set of conditions.  Q:	PSCRIPT.DRV? 	Having done a lot of PS clone testing myself, the unfortunate side of 	testing is the limited number of sources for test files. The primary 	source we use is Genoa. And having characterizes their 1992 PS ATS files, 	(1300+ of them) over half are taken from PSCRIPT.DRV. It may not ideal, 	but the ATS files are what the printer vendors use. I'm sure that Adobe 	uses them too, but Adobe's output is by definition correct, even if its 	wrong.  Yes, there are some very poor clones. We've seen them here at Rastek (a sub of Genicom which has its own clone called GeniScript). Some are poor for lack of design, some are poor because they followed the Red Book, and some are poor because the vendors don't know what PS is.

0	A net worth module.	I've been using Managing Your Money for several years, and I have several friends who use Quicken, though I've not used it myself.  My overall impression is that Quicken is a financial accounts manager while Managing Your Money will help you more completely manage your finances.  Here are some features that I believe Managing Your Money and Quicken share:  	The ability to keep records for each of your financial accounts: 	checking, savings, charge, cash, or brokerage.  You can reconcile 	your account statements with the records the program keeps.  	The ability to make a budget and track your spending against that 	budget.  	A Checkfree module which will allow you to use the Checkfree bill 	paying service to pay your bills via your modem. 	 	The ability to print checks on your printer.  	The ability to keep loan records and set up automatic loan payments.  	The ability to import stock quotations to keep your brokerage accounts 	up to date.  I know Managing Your Money can do this automatically 	via modem.  Quicken probably can as well, but I'm not sure about it.  	The ability to export tax information to popular tax preparation 	programs.   Here are some features that I believe Managing Your Money has that Quicken does not:  	A tax prediction module.  This looks at your accounts and budget to 	predict your tax liability for the coming year.  It's usefull to fine 	tune your withholding so Uncle Sam doesn't get his due too early.  	An insurance and vital records module.  This is a place to keep 	records of your insurance policies as well as other vital records. 	It can also compute your life expectancy.  	A financial analysis module.  This computes compound interest,  	effects of inflation, loan payments term or interest, yield to 	maturity for bonds, savings account yields, days between dates, and 	loan amortization schedules.  It also has functions to help you  	decide whether to refinance your mortgage, whether you can afford 	a particular home, whether a particular rental property is a good 	investment, whether you should buy lease or rent, and whether 	a particular investment's cash flow is adequate for your situation. 	This module can also help you plan for retirement and for helping 	your kids with their tuition.    	A net worth module.  This is a place to record all your assets 	and liabilities.  Your net worth can be computed from this  	information.  Any assets or liabilities recorded in other modules 	are automatically included here.  	A "desk" module.  This includes a small word processor, a card file 	you can use to store names, addresses, phone numbers and other vital 	information about friends and associates, a perpetual calander, a 	rudimentary calculator, a to-do list, a reminder list, an appointment 	list, and a place to record your phone calls (for those who need to 	track such things).  Your appointments, reminders and to-do list 	can be made to display automatically when you start the program.  There are probably some things listed above that Quicken has, but I'm almost sure that Quicken doesn't do everything I've listed.  If I'm wrong, I'm sure hordes of Quicken devotees will flame me to a crisp.  One thing that Quicken has that Managing Your Money does not yet have is a  Windows version.  MECA software is rumored to be working on a Windows version of Managing Your Money for release late this year.

1	Since there are usually 3 VLB slots card makers have been making 
cards to fit in the other two.	V for Video - the origional intention of the bus was to speed up the bus so that large memory to memory transfers would be faster. This is espically useful in transfering data from main memory to video memory.  Since there are usually 3 VLB slots card makers have been making  cards to fit in the other two.   How about an VLB ethernet card? Move the data into the card at 130 odd MB/s and then wait for it to tickle onto the net at just over 1Mb/s.  [ Do do however free the local bus for other cards ]  Some times you need fast busses and sometimes you don't!   Guy

I have successfully used one on a Toshiba laptop by enabling bit 0 of port 0x37f and controlling bit 7 of port 0x37a for the direction of data flow (ie "0" for output, "1" for input).  The same code does not work on my desktop machine. I have heard that i might have to use bit 5 of port 0x37a, however this also does not work.  For a parallel port i am using one of those IDE SUPER I/O cards and have been running a tape backup unit off it via a parallel to scsi converter so i am pretty sure that the printer port is bi-directional.

0	monthly).	Hi      I have never used MYM so I can not help you with the comparison of the two products.  I am, however,  a devoted Quicken user, and I can tell you how to set up the weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly transactions.  First use the Memorize feature (CTRL-M) to record the recurring transactions.  Next, define a transaction group which uses these memorized transactions and specify the frequency that it should be used (i.e. monthly).  Quicken will/can not automatically make the transactions for you, but now all you do is recall the group and all of the individual transactions will be entered at once.  Additionally if you are using the Bill Minder, it will remind you when each transaction group is due.  For example, you could have three transaction groups.  One for payments at the beginning of the month, middle of the month, and one for quarterly payments.  I hope this helps.

Since I have two floppy drives in my system, I'm using a small card (not accelerated) made by Archive to  attach my tape drive as a third floppy device.  The problem: Although the DOS-based QICstream software works just fine, both the Norton and Central Point backup programs for Windows fail unless I switch the machine to non-turbo speed (I'm using a 486DX/33 EISA).  Since the DOS software works, it can't be a hardware problem, can it?  Has anyone seen similar problems?  Any solutions?  Thanks in advance.

1	(not as good as Laser Master's
demo though).	The quality difference is very noticable and is almost worth the wait (for the PS processing) - I'm rather impatient.  We were using it for B&W camera images (RS-170).  The gray scale image was accepted by MS Word and handed to the Winjet PS printer driver which converts the image into postscript and then hands it off to the Winjets postscript processor.  The postscript is rendered into RAM (lots of it) and when it is done it shoots it directly to the printer.  The PS processor can also accept PS files created from other sources including DOS applications, but Windows has to be running at the time of printing.  The PS processor is responsible for the halftoning and I'd say it does a pretty good job.  Our camera images came out very good in my opinion.  (not as good as Laser Master's demo though).  I don't know how many other similar products are out there but I would be surprised if there are several.
1	If you wrote your own routine instead of the BIOS, it
    would speed it up some, but the time would still be there.	      The joystick reads in anolog values through a digital port. How?     You send a command to the port to read it, then you time how long     it takes for the joystick port to set a certain bit.  This time     is proportional to the joystick position.  Obviously, since time     is used as a position, you cannot get rid of this ridiculus waste      of time.  If you wrote your own routine instead of the BIOS, it     would speed it up some, but the time would still be there.  --

1	Just seeing that I rank a monitor differently
from Windows Sources is meaningless without knowing how we did the
ranking.	   One of the monitors I reviewed for the June issue of Windows Magazine was the Mitsubishi.  I also reviewed a new Nanao, the F550iW, which has just been released.  Last year for the May '92 issue of Windows, I reviewed several monitors, including the Nanao T560i.  There's no question that the Nanao monitors are the best available this year, just as they were last year.  The difference between my ranking of the best in Windows and the ranking in Windows Sources is due mainly to a difference in the testing criteria and the scoring.  I used different tests than they did, and I scored differently.  There's nothing wrong with the Mitsubishi, and it scored very highly in my tests, but it was a few points shy of perfect.  Incidentally, one of the things everyone should do when they're reading reviews of any product, whether it's monitors or mice, is to read the criteria and methodology carefully.  Unless you know how the product testing was done, and on what the scores are based, you can't possibly know what they really mean.  Just seeing that I rank a monitor differently from Windows Sources is meaningless without knowing how we did the ranking.  Likewise, it's impossible to tell whether a monitor will meet your needs unless you know how we did the testing.  After all, some of what we do may not apply to you.  Likewise, some of what we do may apply more closely in one review than in another.

is cheaper; ESDI is hard to find and rather costly.	You, the Net, are my last resort, or I'll just change my job :-) This might be a FAQ (e.g. mixing controllers) but haven't seen any.  Sys: 486/33, AMI BIOS, and your run-of-the mill multi-I/O card with serials/paral/floppies and  	- IDE controller "clone" Gw2760-EX 		there are no jumpers affecting the HD or ctrller :-(  	- Quantum ProDrive LPS (3" 105M type 47: 755cyl, 16hds, 17spt).  Pb: I want to bring in this (2nd hand, neat price): 	- Maxtor XT-B380E (~330M, <15ms, BIOS type 1, ctrller manages 		the real geom: 1630cyl, 8hds, 52spt) 	- Western Digital WD1007V-SE1 ESDI ctrller: no floppies. 		(jumpers set IRQ 14/15, hw port addr 1F0/170, 		and BIOS addr CC00/C800, and other floppy/format stuff)  Goal: have the WD ESDI as a secondary/controller and have both disks  simultaneously working. Being able to boot from the ESDI too would be  a nice bonus but is not expected.  Ultimate goal: have room for Linux et al. Ex of scheme I have in mind: boot from IDE (HD or floppy) and mount the ESDI as root. Not booting from ESDI, or even from HD, is acceptable.  I have tried numerous (all!!) combinations to no avail. They work alone, or can coexist witout hang-ups but can't access the ESDI or the IDE,  depending on setup/jumpers.  Useful suggestions might be: - How do I tell the BIOS setup about two ctrllers (I guess the 2nd HD is expected to hang off the same ctrller as the 1st). - Do I need some driver to make it work? - --- " --- some new BIOS/chip for any of these cards? - do I have to buy another controller to make them HDs happy? IDE is cheaper; ESDI is hard to find and rather costly. I'm not  rich or I wouldnt' try to scavenge around, so soft slns are preferred. - adapters of some sort; I can hold a soldering iron, and can change a chip or put a jumper!  Also useful: - BBS or Hot-line of Western Digital. - ftp archives with relevant info. - expert stores in Toronto, Ontario area (that would be a miracle! haven't seen any really knowledgeable ppl in a while) - any hints into inner workings of the system ...  - anything else that helped you in similar situations (prayers :-) )  Direct or posted replies are ok. 	Many thanks, 			Cat.

0	Now
watch what happens to that icon as you press and release the Ctrl key
(keeping the mouse button pressed all the while).	I tried to respond by email, but all attempts bounced.  The condition of the Ctrl key BEFORE you press the mouse button makes no difference whatsoever.  You have to be holding the Ctrl key when you RELEASE the mouse button if you want to force a copy operation.  Here's a simple experiment.  Select a file and begin to drag it (no Ctrl key).  Notice that the file's icon disappears from the listing window.  Now watch what happens to that icon as you press and release the Ctrl key (keeping the mouse button pressed all the while).  In addition, the icon that you are dragging will show a "+" while you are holding the Ctrl key, indicating that the file is being copied rather than moved. 
0	All of them just make the statement that TrueType fonts will print
exactly as you see them on the screen---so I assume Windows knows that a font
has to be downloaded automatically---but, how to make it do that???	When I use the font in CorelDRAW, the document prints correctly, so I assume CorelDRAW knows that the font has to be downloaded to the printer.  But when I use the Windows accessory Write, the printer prints square boxes in place of the characters of the new font. Yet, Write does display the font correctly on the screen.  I looked through all the Windows and LaserJet manuals, but got nowhere. All of them just make the statement that TrueType fonts will print exactly as you see them on the screen---so I assume Windows knows that a font has to be downloaded automatically---but, how to make it do that????
0	Please e-mail any responses, since I don't get to read the news too often.	When running DOS 5.0 under Windows 3.0, I lose the ability to do a print-screen. I have no problem with this when I'm running DOS not under Windows. If it's relavant, I'm using 'Quarterdeck 6.0' expanded memory manager for my 386.   Please e-mail any responses, since I don't get to read the news too often.     Thanks in advance.

Windows switches to 1024x768, switches back to text-mode and exits
to DOS.	Hi,  I got a problem too, with a 486DX2-66 VLB, 4 Mb RAM,  170Mb disk. Sometimes, when I switch on the computer, it starts Windows (3.1 Dutch) Windows switches to 1024x768, switches back to text-mode and exits to DOS. After one or two resets, the system works fine...

as other entries (e.g.	equation=equation,equation,<path\filename>,picture.  didn't work. quit windows, go back.  AHA: mistake. Correct it.  It looks fine. start windows...doesn't work.  play with it for a while, at one point having two entries to see if one works and th'other don't, and finally I get it to work.  The only thing I can see that's different now is that it's now the first item on the list, and it used to be the last.  But now I end up with *three* "equation" entried, and *all* of them working. (and only one entry in win.ini).  so does any netian know what's wrong? or rather, how to correct this? (i.e. make "equation"appear but once?).  Also, all the entries in the [embedding] appear as above. It's obvious that <path\filename> is the executable, or whatever, and "picture" has something to do withthe way it appears (picture/description?)  but what are the others? i.e., in  soundrec=sound,sound, whate's the difference between the 1st "sound" and the 2nd?   and what is "soundrec"?? (I don't think it's the name of the executable, as other entries (e.g. MSWorksChart=...) aren't)  thanks, i.a. Mickey
1	Note that my Stealth 24's video BIOS at C000-C7FF is being shadowed
through the AMI BIOS.	What are some possible causes of the card slowing down like this?  I ran the Qualitas ASQ diagnostic program on memory, and I noted the following memory timings on my machine:  ASQ v1.30 by Qualitas  SYSTEM ANALYSIS  Mon Apr 19, 1993  11:43:49AM    page: 1 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  ACCESS TIMING       Hex     KB     KB   Access Speed Ratio (%)   Start  Start   Size  Time us 0   25   50  75  100      00000      0     32      396 ******************   00800     32     32      598 *****************   01000     64     32      157 ********************   01800     96     32      180 ********************   02000    128     64      157 ********************   03000    192     32      165 ********************   03800    224    128      156 ********************   05800    352     96      169 ********************   07000    448     32      153 ********************   07800    480     32      188 ********************   08000    512     96      158 ********************   09800    608     32      171 ********************   0A000    640     96     1221 **************   0B800    736     32     1581 ************   0C000    768     32      312 *******************   0C800    800     96      154 ********************   0E000    896     64     3957 *   0F000    960     64      312 *******************  Note two things on this chart:  1) The video memory appears to be many orders of magnitude slower than system memory.

What's going on there?  Note that my Stealth 24's video BIOS at C000-C7FF is being shadowed through the AMI BIOS.    Any ideas on what might be happening here? 
1	Can anyone offer any suggestions?	I have a problem with my floppy drives. In an effort to make my 3.5" drive  (normally b:) my a: drive, I switched the order of connections on the cable  from the serial card/floppy/ide controller. I booted up, changed the CMOS settings to reflect the a: drive as the 3.5 and the b: drive as the 5.25. The drive lights didn't come on, and there was a failure trying to read from those drives.  I switched the cables back to their original positions, and then booted-up and restored the original CMOS settings. The lights for the floppies came on during this process, and they stay on for as long as the computer is on. I see that when there is a disk in a:, the drive is spinning, yet there seems to be no disk access. MSD.EXE and Norton SI detect both drives, but when I  try to get detailed information about a: or b:, Norton SI tells me that there is no disk in the drive.  Can anyone offer any suggestions? I'm in desperate need of help!!!  Thank you for your time.
1	I also find it to be
the case that the majority of the software that is BAD in this regard
is COMMERCIAL software.	Unfortunately there a *LOT* of such software.  I also find it to be the case that the majority of the software that is BAD in this regard is COMMERCIAL software.  Way too many commercial packages are very poorly written.  But then most of the programs in MS-DOS are crap, such as the PRINT command TSR that locks up your system for long periods of time when the printer is full instead of trying every clock tick.  Back to comm software... I find success with TELIX (my COM3 at 3e8/5 works ok on TELIX).
0	Will it use the Windows sockets ?	What the status of Trumpet for Windows? Will it use the Windows sockets ? I liked it in DOS but had to abandon it since I started using NDIS to access our token ring (results in invalid class error :(   Bye!
1	NOT
the interface itself but more and more from drive mechanisims to use the
SCSI-2 through put.	IBM HD Interfaces {limited to hard drives by design or lack of development}: [...] IDE:  Integrated Device Electronics   currently the most common standard, and is mainly used for medium sized   drives. Can have more than one hard drive. Asynchronous Transfer: ~5MB/s max.  So at its LOWEST setting SCSI-2 interface in Asynchronous SCSI-1 mode AVERAGES  the through put MAXIMUM of IDE in asynchronous mode.  In full SCSI-2 mode it blows poor IDE out the window, down the street, and into the garbage can. The problem becomes can the drive mechanisim keep up with those through put rates and THAT is where the bottleneck and cost of SCSI-2 comes from.  NOT the interface itself but more and more from drive mechanisims to use the SCSI-2 through put.  The cost of SCSI interface is a self fulliling prophisy: few people buy SCSI because it is so expencive for the PC, which in turn convices makes that mass producing SCSI {which would reduce its cost} is unwarented, and so SCSI is expencive. {That is the effect of the Rule of Scale: the more items sold the less EACH item has to bare the brunt the cost of manufacture and so the less each item has to cost}

1	It MUST also work
under OS/2 and be compatible with Stacker (and other Disk Compression S/W).	I would like to hear the net.wisdom and net.opinions on IDE Controllers. I would liek to get a IDE controller card for my VLB DX2 66 Motherboard. What are good options for this (preferably under $200). It MUST also work under OS/2 and be compatible with Stacker (and other Disk Compression S/W).  Please advise .....  Divya --  Divya

1	Should I
go with Micron just because it has the Micronics motherboard?	I said that this might be a silly question since I believe that Micronics is a very well known motherboard manufacturer while I never heard of Cache! I am however leaning towards the Ares machine because my impression is that they are known for building good, solid machines and they have good tech support (24 hr, 7 days/wk), and a better warrantee (2 years).  Micron, on the other hand, seems to have recently aquired Edge Technologies and I'm not sure how much I should trust the company.  I would REALLY appreciate any input on this. Is the Micron machine the clear choice?  Does anyone know anything positive or negative about either company? Has anyone ever heard of Cache motherboards? Should I go with Micron just because it has the Micronics motherboard? etc.  Thanks very much in advance for any information.

1	Experienced mail order buyers know that there are some mail order
companies that give excellent service, including overnight replacement parts, 
on-site calls, etc.	When it comes to local dealers:  - Have fun getting consistently good support.  Most of their "techs" are re-treaded salesmen, not trained technicians, with a high turnover rate.  - Have fun getting in-warranty work done quickly and courteously.  - Have fun getting out-of-warranty work done cheaply, or even done period, unless you are on a paid service contract.  Having been both a service technician, and a service manager, at a ComputerLand franchise and another retail computer place, I know what I'm talking about.   I also know the "local service" scam that retail computer dealers like to push when they're selling.  It's that same old song that car dealers having been singing for years -- "Buy from me and you'll get good service. We always treat our customers right!  Buy from my competition and you'll be sorry if you need service."   Experienced mail order buyers know that there are some mail order companies that give excellent service, including overnight replacement parts,  on-site calls, etc. There are probably some local dealers that can give you good service, too. But if you think all local dealers give consistenly good  service, you are wrong.  I have many anectdotes to prove my point,  but I'm sure there are others on the net can do a better job than I can.

0	Who has had to deal with it ?	Until recently no one concidered using any version control to mediate, and as    a result, the 5 programmers spent a great deal of time merging files together    at the end of each week so that a new system could be build. We are now trying   to streamline this process, but are hampered by the lack of software that will   allow us to share files across PC and MAC platforms.                              I understand that PVCS used to do this, but that they no longer support the MAC  product (anyone know why ??  Polytron ?).                                         I have seen people ask about development in multiple platforms, so I assume that ours is not a new problem.  Who has had to deal with it ?  What solutions have   you come up with?                                                                 thanks in advance for any and all suggestions via posting or EMAIL. If there are enough EMAIL responses then I will post a synopsis of the knowledge.              -Charles Emmons

By your OWN data the "Although SCSI is twice as fast as ESDI" is correct
With a SCSI-2 controller chip SCSI-1 can reach 10MB/s which is indeed
"20% faster than IDE" {120% of 8.3 is 9.96}.	SCSI-1 {with a SCSI-1 controler chip} range is indeed 0-5MB/s and that is ALL you have right about SCSI SCSI-1 {With a SCSI-2 controller chip}: 4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst {8-bit}  Note the INCREASE in SPEED, the Mac Quadra uses this version of SCSI-1  so it DOES exist. Some PC use this set up too. SCSI-2 {8-bit/SCSI-1 mode}:          4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst SCSI-2 {16-bit/wide or fast mode}:  8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst SCSI-2 {32-bit/wide AND fast}:     15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst   By your OWN data the "Although SCSI is twice as fast as ESDI" is correct With a SCSI-2 controller chip SCSI-1 can reach 10MB/s which is indeed "20% faster than IDE" {120% of 8.3 is 9.96}. ALL these SCSI facts have been posted to this newsgroup in my Mac & IBM info sheet {available by FTP on  sumex-aim.stanford.edu (36.44.0.6) in the info-mac/report as  mac-ibm-compare[version #].txt (It should be 173 but 161 may still be there)}  Part of this problem is both Mac and IBM PC are inconsiant about what SCSI is which.  Though it is WELL documented that the Quadra has a SCSI-2 chip an Apple salesperson said "it uses a fast SCSI-1 chip" {Not at a 6MB/s, 10MB/s burst it does not. SCSI-1 is 5MB/s maximum synchronous and Quadra uses ANsynchronous SCSI which is SLOWER}  It seems that Mac and IBM see SCSI-1 interface and think 'SCSI-1' when it maybe a SCSI-1 interface driven in the machine by a SCSi-2 controller chip in 8-bit mode {Which is MUCH FASTER then true SCSI-1 can go}.
1	This results in 
a flatter screen than other 17" monitors using the standard trinitron 
(which has a vertically flat but not horizontally flat surface), and 
apparently the ability to provide a tighter beam focus.  
	The 2 lines are not a result of the high end trinitron tube, these 2 wires will be found on all 17" trinitron tubes (e.g., Mitsubishi 17", Sony 1604, etc).  On 14" Sony tubes, you'll find one wire.  Their level of annoyance is purely subjective.  I'm so happy with the sharpness of the T560i that I don't even notice the lines.  The T560i uses a Trinitron SA tube which, when viewed as a complete tube, has a larger diameter than the standard Trinitron tube.  This results in  a flatter screen than other 17" monitors using the standard trinitron  (which has a vertically flat but not horizontally flat surface), and  apparently the ability to provide a tighter beam focus.   
1	The result are lost characters or broken transmissions because of timeouts.	 If you ran dos, you don't need a 16550, because dos runs only ONE task at a time and the whole cpu-power could be used for the transfer. But if you are running a multitasking OS such as OS/2, Unix, etc. ( windows ? :-) ), the cpu cannot work the whole time with one task.   The result are lost characters or broken transmissions because of timeouts.   NO. The only diffrence is that internal modems have the UART on board, whereas external modems are connected to the computer over a serial port which has the UART on board.   I use a Zyxel1496B with a 16550UART under COHERENT 4.0. I'm very satisfied with it but I think that nearly everyone is satisfied with his own modem.  Michael

0	This is the only way I can think of.	You could use DOS 6 to do this partly.  You can set up different config.sys and autoexec.bat commands for each user, and they just have to select their menu option on bootup.  Then you can have the autoexec.bat copy the win.ini and system.ini files and change directories for them.  When they exit windows, it can copy back generic .ini files if you want.  This is the only way I can think of.  There may be some programs somewhere that allow you to do this better, though using DOS 6 allows each person to have a custom config.sys and autoexec.bat.
0	Now there may be
better alternatives.
	The reason I wanted to reply in public instead of private mail is because of following: I talked to their tech support a few days ago and was told that I can expect a new version near the end of the month. Which should be about now...  However, I have a problem when switching back from a DOS session in standard mode. Apparently they don't know of this problem and seem to be surprised why anybody would want to use standard mode at all.   It's a great card for the price, at least when I bought it. Now there may be better alternatives.

modem was one of the reasons I sought out the Diamond Speedstar 24X.	Tell him he probably needs to upgrade to a faster video card!  My 9600 baud modem was one of the reasons I sought out the Diamond Speedstar 24X. I get about 7 million WinMarks on my 386-25 and it just about keeps up with the modem speed (using procomm plus for windows, too).  He should get over 10 million on his machine with the same card.  Anything 10+ should yield acceptable speed...  
1	So when I do a sequential read on the outer tracks, WHY am I getting a
measly 862KB/sec when I should be getting around 3MB/sec???	What is the deal with the IDE transfer rates?  Is anybody getting throughput anywhere close to the platter->controller rate?  I haven't seen anything even close to the 5MB/sec limit of the IDE interface.  These drives are 1:1 (non-interleaved), aren't they?  Here are the rates I get:  1) sequential read (MSDOS C program that uses bios calls to read 64-sector                     blocks sequentially from outside (first) track inward)                       8mhz bus    10mhz bus                      --------    ---------    MAXTOR LXT340:    860KB/sec   976KB/sec    QUANTUM LPS240:   862KB/sec   887KB/sec  2) disk buffer read (same C program, but re-reads the same block repeatedly                      so in effect is reading the RAM buffer on the drive)                       8mhz bus    10mhz bus                      --------    ---------    MAXTOR LXT340:   1046KB/sec  1212KB/sec    QUANTUM LPS240:  1015KB/sec  1276KB/sec  3) CORETEST V2.7 transfer rate (seems to agree with (2) above)                       8mhz bus    10mhz bus                      --------    ---------    MAXTOR LXT340:   1051KB/sec  1224KB/sec    QUANTUM LPS240:  1026KB/sec  1298KB/sec  I managed to get hold of the QUANTUM LPS240AT product manual and it goes into excrutiating detail describing how the bits get from the platter, through the controller, and out the IDE interface.  Nowhere do I see anything like "after the bits are whipped of the platter at high speed they sit around in a buffer to thaw before they are sent to the host" (even though I SWEAR that's whats happening ;->).  Here are some relevent quotes from the manual:    "Data is transferred from the disk to the read buffer at a rate of    3.75 MB/s maximum, 1.87MB/s minimum."  (My calculations show 3121KB/sec    maximum and 1578KB/sec minimum...  disk spins at 4306 RPM with 87    sectors per track on the outside and 44 on the inside)    "Single burst errors of up to 24 bits within one sector can be corrected    'on-the-fly', in real time as they occur, allowing a high degree of    data integrity with no impact to the drive's performance."  (I take    this to mean error correction isn't the bottleneck)    "For page-mode operations, the data-transfer rate to and from the buffer    RAM is up to 10.0 MB/s. This high transfer rate allows the AT Interface    IC to communicate over the AT bus at a data-transfer rate of 5.0 MB/s,    while the DCS simultaneously controls disk-to-RAM transfers"                  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ So the thing can even do it's cache pre-fetch WHILE it's sending the requested sector (it has 3 64KB read buffers for pre-fetching, I guess you could call that a cache :-|).  So when I do a sequential read on the outer tracks, WHY am I getting a measly 862KB/sec when I should be getting around 3MB/sec???  Any of you hard-disk engineers out there know?

I easily challenged him on that because I've been running a Diamond 24x in 15 bit mode at home for 4 months now, and I have "Well, Diamond has been working on those drivers much longer."  Anyway, I just wanted to see if anyone else had any trouble and what they did about it.  Any feedback will be appreciated.  The system configuration is:  Gateway 486 DX2/66 Local Bus 16 Megs Ram SCSI HD & CD-ROM Ultrastor 34F Local Bus SCSI controller ATI Ultra Pro Local Bus with 2MB VRAM DOS 6.0 Windows 3.1 Mach 32 drivers version 1.5 (build 59)  Thanks in advance.
1	However, the hardware for these two boards is not 100% identical, and
  there is at least one (NON-MSDOS) program that initially did not work
  with a 1542A, but did work with a 1542B (BSD386 -- a 386 version of
  BSD Unix).	     Here's a document that I wrote some time back.  It's slightly out-of-date, now that DOS 6 has been released, but much of it is still useful.       -- Darryl Okahata 	Internet: darrylo@sr.hp.com  DISCLAIMER: this message is the author's personal opinion and does not constitute the support, opinion or policy of Hewlett-Packard or of the little green men that have been following him all day.  =============================================================================== $Id: adaptec.txt 1.8 1993/01/25 00:55:08 darrylo Rel darrylo $           Hints and Tips for the Adaptec 1540/1542 SCSI adapter        This document contains hints and tips for getting the Adaptec 1540/1542 SCSI adapter to work with various hardware and software packages.

However, just in case something went wrong, I'm going to describe some of the changes needed to get Windows 3.1 working with the 1542.  Also, you may have noticed that installing Windows 3.1 makes your PC run much slower, even when you're not running Windows; methods of speeding it up are discussed in the section called, "Windows 3.1 runs slowly".   * MSDOS configuration:       The Windows install program adds the SmartDrive disk cache to your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files.  If you follow the instructions, you'll notice that you'll need to use double-buffering with SmartDrive (this is the default setup).  You'll also notice that your system runs much, much slower -- in both Windows *AND* MSDOS.  See the section called, "Windows 3.1 runs slowly", for some ways of speeding your system up.   * Windows configuration:       To get the Adaptec 1542 to work with Windows, make sure that the "[388Enh]" section of the SYSTEM.INI file contains the entry:  	VirtualHDIRQ=Off  I believe that the Windows install program automatically adds this entry to SYSTEM.INI, but I'm not sure.  If this doesn't work for you, you might want to try adding some more lines:  	VirtualHDIRQ=Off 	SystemROMBreakPoint=false 	EMMExclude=A000-CFFF  (You probably don't need the above lines, though.)  The "SystemROMBreakPoint" entry is used to enable support for memory managers like QEMM/386MAX (only needed if you use such programs).   * Windows 3.1 runs slowly:       Once you do get Windows 3.1 running with the 1542, chances are that your system is running much slower than before.  If it's not, it's probably because:       1. You happen to be using ASPI4DOS.SYS version 3.1 in your 	CONFIG.SYS file.  Congratulations -- this appears to be a 	winning solution.       2. You are very lucky.  Whether your luck will hold out remains to 	be seen ....  If your system is running much slower than before, this is almost definitely caused by Smartdrive with double-buffering.  According to the Windows documentation, and the Microsoft technical note #Q81808 ("SMARTDrive Double Buffering Required with ASPI4DOS.SYS"), you must use Smartdrive with double-buffering enabled.  While this works, it really slows down your PC; I once estimated that this slowed my PC down by a factor of 5 (FIVE).  As I consider this unacceptable, I looked for other solutions.       Unfortunately, you cannot just disable double-buffering.  If you do, Windows 3.1 in enhanced mode will not work, and you might even destroy the contents of your hard disk by trying to run Windows 3.1. What you can do is one of the following:       1. Use other drivers that provide double-buffering.  It is my 	opinion that the unbelievable slowness in Smartdrive is caused 	either by horribly inefficient double-buffering, or by a bug in 	Smartdrive.       2. Use a driver that provides "VDS" services ("VDS" stands for 	"Virtual DMA Services").  This is a standard, which is supported 	by Windows 3.1, that allows bus-mastering disk controllers (like 	the 1542) to work with Windows.       After trashing my hard disk countless times, I found the following solutions, none of which require using Smartdrive (note, however, that I am now getting occasional parity errors, which are probably *NOT* caused by these solutions, but might be -- see below).  While the following does not require Smartdrive, using some kind of disk cache utility is strongly recommended, as this makes Windows run much, much faster:  1. If you do not have the ASPI4DOS.SYS driver, or you do not need ASPI    functions (for controlling a CDROM, tape drive, more than two    physical hard disks, etc.), you can add the SCSIHA.SYS driver to your    CONFIG.SYS file, e.g.:  	DRIVER=c:\SCSIHA.SYS /V386     (Windows needs the "/V386" option.)  This driver MUST be loaded into    LOW memory (it cannot be loaded into high memory), and it occupies    about 16-20K.  As of November 1992, the SCSIHA.SYS driver could be    obtained from the Adaptec BBS at (408)-945-7727 (hopefully, it's    still there).  2. If you need ASPI functions and have the ASPI4DOS.SYS driver, version    3.0 or 3.0a, you can use both the ASPI4DOS.SYS and SCSIHA.SYS drivers    in your CONFIG.SYS file, e.g.:  	DRIVER=c:\ASPI4DOS.SYS 	DRIVER=c:\SCSIHA.SYS /V386     Amazingly enough, the SCSIHA.SYS driver can also be loaded high    (assuming you have DOS 5.0); I would have thought that this would    crash my system, but it doesn't.  I asked Adaptec's technical support    about this, and they said that loading SCSIHA.SYS high should be fine    as long as ASPI4DOS.SYS is loaded LOW.     On my system, NOT using SCSIHA.SYS with ASPI4DOS 3.0a would    occasionally cause Windows 3.1 to crash upon restarting or exiting    Windows, with the additional result of a corrupted disk (some of my    C:\WINDOWS\*.GRP files would be corrupted).  For me, these crashes    usually occurred while making a different program from PROGMAN.EXE    the default Windows shell, and vice-versa.  This is the reason    SCSIHA.SYS may be necessary.     I have absolutely no idea if SCSIHA.SYS is necessary with versions of    ASPI4DOS earlier than 3.0.     Note that many people can use ASPI4DOS 3.0 or 3.0a without    SCSIHA.SYS; they do not seem to have any problems at all.  I consider    these people lucky.  Others, like me, have had all sorts of problems.  3. In my opinion, the best, but not necessarily the easiest, solution is    to upgrade to ASPI4DOS 3.1.  The SCSIHA.SYS driver is no longer    needed.  Unfortunately, while you could get previous ASPI4DOS    upgrades from the Adaptec BBS, the ASPI4DOS 3.1 driver is not    available from the Adaptec BBS.  As far as I know, there are only    three ways to get a copy:        * You can buy the new (as of November 1992) Adaptec EZ SCSI driver 	kit, which supposedly includes ASPI4DOS 3.1 as well as other 	drivers, such as CDROM drivers.  I believe the list price is 	around $75.        * If you already have a copy of an older version of ASPI4DOS, you 	can supposedly contact Adaptec to upgrade it to EZ SCSI for 	around $30.        * A copy of ASPI4DOS 3.1 is included in Central Point PC Tools 8.0 	for MSDOS.  Note that the documentation and driver are stored in 	different directories.  Note further that only ASPI4DOS is 	included; the CDROM drivers and drivers to support more than two 	hard disks are not included.  This is where I obtained my copy 	of ASPI4DOS 3.1.  Note, however, that I am now getting occasional parity errors with Windows.  In all probability, defective hardware in my PC is causing this, as I upgraded my motherboard just after I found the above solutions.  However, because these parity errors occur only during disk accesses, there is a very small, but definite, possibility that the parity errors are driver-related (for example, changing the bus on/off timing for certain disk transfers might cause this).  I've run various memory tests for hours at a time, and these tests have found no problems.  This problem is probably caused by memory with marginal timing requirements, which cause parity errors during disk transfers (this is why the memory tests didn't find any problems -- the problems show up only under disk I/O).  However, I'm mentioning this just in case it isn't a hardware problem.   ***** Floppy-controller-based tape backup devices:       There are two possible problems with using the Adaptec 1542 with a floppy-controller-based tape backup device, such as the Colorado Memory Systems Jumbo 250:  1. Tape backups/restores can take a very long time.  The tape drive    constantly starts, stops, starts, stops, etc.  2. Tape operations may be erratic, or encounter too many tape errors.    (This problem might be caused by defective hardware on my 1542.    However, I've heard of other people having similar problems, and so    I'm mentioning this just in case it is not a hardware problem on my    1542.)   * Tape backups/restores take a long time:       If you have a floppy-controller-based tape backup device, you may have to adjust the Adaptec 1540/1542 "bus on/off timing" for best results when using the tape drive.  Normally, while doing a tape backup or restore, the tape drive motor should be continuously running, with only an occasional pause.  However, the default bus timing on the Adaptec 1540/1542 may cause the tape drive motor to start and stop, start and stop, every few seconds.  This causes needless wear to the tape and tape drive (however, note that a dirty tape head or a defective tape drive can also cause this -- make sure your tape heads are clean). This also causes the tape backup or restore to take much, much longer than necessary.       The problem here is that these tape backups use the floppy DMA to transfer data in memory to/from the tape drive, and the Adaptec uses DMA to transfer data in memory to/from the hard disk.  The floppy DMA needs to feed data to the tape drive at a certain rate; if the tape drive is not fed data quickly enough by the floppy DMA, the tape drive stops, rewinds a bit, and restarts (once enough data is eventually fed to it). The default bus timing on the Adaptec (which is really DMA timing) is "too large".  For example, when a backup is done, data has to be transferred from a hard disk to memory, and then from memory to the tape.  Because the default timing on the Adaptec "hogs" the memory too much (too much time is spent transferring data from a hard disk to memory), not enough time is spent transferring data from memory to the tape drive.  As a result, the tape drive constantly starts and stops, because data is not fed to it quickly enough.       The solution is to change the Adaptec's bus on/off timing.  The default factory setting is 11 microseconds on, and 5 microseconds off. The "bus on" timing needs to be lowered to 2-4 microseconds.  This can be done in one of two ways:  * If you have ASPI4DOS, you can use the "/n" option.  For example, I use   a "bus on" timing of 4 microseconds, which means that I use the   following line in my CONFIG.SYS file:  	DEVICE=c:\aspi4dos.sys /n4    Note that there is NO space between the "/n" and the "4".  * If you don't have ASPI4DOS, your only recourse is to try to find a   program called "SETSCSI.EXE", which is very difficult to find.  The   reason is that Adaptec, for reasons of their own, does not seem to   want this widely distributed.  I once asked someone who worked for   Adaptec, and they asked me to not upload it anywhere.  If you have   anonymous ftp access to the Internet, you could try using archie to   hunt down a copy; I believe that there are a couple of sites that have   it.  If you do find a copy, you run it like so:  	setscsi -n:4    This adjusts the "bus on" timing to 4 microseconds.  Running   SETSCSI.EXE without any arguments resets the bus timing back to the   factory defaults.    Note that it seems that you cannot use SETSCSI.EXE if you use   ASPI4DOS; SETSCSI.EXE crashed my system if ASPI4DOS was loaded.  I   could use SETSCSI.EXE with SCSIHA.SYS, however.  Do not lower the "bus on" timing below 2 microseconds, or increase it above 11 microseconds.  If you lower it too low, the hard disk throughput will suddenly drop; your system will feel slower.  For me, 4 microseconds works fine.  This value may work fine for you, or you may have to adjust it downwards a little.       Once you've lowered the "bus on" timing, tape backups and restores should run faster.       Also, do not experiment with the bus on/off times (with the other options that I have intentionally not described), unless you know what you are doing.  Bad combinations can cause parity errors and worse, by starving memory refresh.       A program called BUSTIFIX.EXE exists on the Adaptec BBS.  Unless this has been upgraded since I last checked (which has been a while), this is a self-extracting archive containing a batch file and a couple of other files.  This batch file was supposed to allow one to set the bus on/off times for the 1540/1542 and others.  However, when I tried running this program with my 1542A, my system crashed.  At the time, I was running SCSIHA.SYS, and I didn't check to see if there was a conflict with it.  Maybe this old program works only with the 1542B, although the docs say that it works with the 1542A?   * Erratic tape operations or too many tape errors:       This "problem" may or may not exist.  Although it existed on my system, a hardware problem just on my particular 1542 could cause it. However, I've heard of other people having similar problems, and so I'm mentioning this just in case it isn't a hardware problem just on my 1542.       Symptoms of this "problem", which persists even after cleaning the tape head:  1. Backing up to tape encounters "unusable sector detected" errors,    resulting in an aborted tape backup.  2. Tape backup works, but the tape compare fails.  3. The tape drive starts, stops, starts, stops, etc. much too often.    Unlike the above-mentioned problem ("Tape backups/restores take a    long time"), where the tape drive starts and stops every few seconds,    this kind of starting/stopping occurs every few 10-20 seconds or so.  4. Fastback Plus 3.1 does not find/see any tape backup devices.  Other    programs, like Central Point Backup and the CMS Jumbo software    (assuming that you have a CMS Jumbo 250 tape drive) can find/see the    tape drive, but Fastback Plus 3.1 cannot.  5. Too many tape read errors.       Although I do not know what is causing this problem, I discovered that using a different floppy controller solves it.  A few months ago, I upgraded my motherboard, which contained an integrated floppy controller.  As I already had a floppy controller on the 1542, I initially disabled the motherboard floppy controller.  After a while, I decided to try disabling the 1542 floppy controller and using the one on the motherboard.  When I did this, the tape drive (a CMS Jumbo 250) reliability increased dramatically, and Fastback Plus 3.1 was suddenly able to find and use the tape drive.       I don't know if this was caused by a hardware problem on my 1542. On the one hand, the floppy drives worked great when they were attached to the 1542, which seems to say that there was nothing wrong with the 1542.  On the other hand, the tape drive didn't work well attached to the 1542 floppy controller, but it did work when attached to a different controller; this could be an indication of a hardware problem on my 1542.  I did change floppy drive cables, and so it is conceivable that the problem was in the cables.  I don't know what the cause really is; however, if you're having similar problems, you might want to consider trying a new floppy controller.   ***** Sound cards:       Many popular sound cards can play or record digitized sound, and this is typically done using DMA.  Like the tape drive DMA, the Adaptec's DMA can conflict with the sound card DMA.  Unlike that of the tape DMA, this "conflict" usually manifests itself as a parity error (your system crashes with a parity error message).  What happens is that, data is being transferred so quickly by the sound card and the Adaptec, memory refresh cannot occur quickly enough, which causes a parity error.  Usually, getting a parity error means that there is a hardware problem with your system; in this case, however, the parity error is not a symptom of bad hardware.       I've found that such parity errors typically occur while recording digitized sound, and the chances of such errors increase as you increase the recording fidelity (e.g., higher sampling rate, recording in stereo, recording using 16-bits instead of 8, etc.).       Like the tape drive solution, the solution here is to lower the Adaptec's "bus on" timing.  See the section on tape drives for information on how this is done.  Note, however, that this may or may not solve the problem; it may only reduce the probability of a parity error.  The software used to record digitized sound can greatly affect this problem (i.e., some software is inefficient).  Disk caches, the speed of your hard disk, and the amount of disk fragmentation can also affect this.   ***** Miscellaneous info:       This section contains miscellaneous hints, tips, and rumors.  Much of it is merely information that I've heard or read about, and have not verified.  I believe that the following information is correct, but I'm not sure.  Use it at your own risk.  * With QEMM 6.00, 6.01, and 6.02, you need to specify the "DB="   parameter (e.g., "DB=2"), unless you are using the ASPI4DOS driver.   If you don't, QEMM will crash/hang at bootup.  Although the QEMM   manual mentions this, the install program does not seem to detect that   a 1542 is present and automatically add this option to the QEMM   command line (at least, this occurred with the QEMM 6.00 install   program -- I haven't tested any other version).  Earlier versions of   QEMM probably need this parameter, but I'm not sure (I've never used a   version earlier than 6.00).    If you use ASPI4DOS, you do not need to give QEMM the "DB=" parameter.  * Some or all versions of the 1542 do not support hard disks over one   gigabyte in size.  To support hard disks with capacities over 1GB, you   need to get a new ROM BIOS from Adaptec.  I'm not sure if this is   still true of the latest 1542Bs being sold by Adaptec.  * To connect a CDROM drive to the 1542, you need a SCSI CDROM drive and   some drivers.  Note that some CDROM drives have proprietary interfaces   (non-SCSI); these drives cannot be used with the 1542.  You have three   choices for CDROM drivers (I have no idea how well the following   solutions work, or even if they work -- the following is secondhand   information):       1. You can buy Adaptec's EZ SCSI driver package, which lists for 	something like $75.  If you already have older Adaptec drivers, 	you can supposedly upgrade to EZ SCSI for around $30.  Contact 	Adaptec for details.  The EZ SCSI package supposedly contains 	everything that you need.       2. You can buy the CorelSCSI! driver package, which is made by the 	same people that make CorelDRAW!  This package contains CDROM 	drivers, SCSI tape drivers, WORM drivers, etc.  I do not know 	the list price, but I've seen this package sold for around 	$80-$90.  Note that CorelSCSI! does not come with the ASPI4DOS 	driver, which is needed.  If you do not already have ASPI4DOS, 	you may be better off getting Adaptec's EZ SCSI instead.       3. [This method is obsolete, as the following drivers have been 	obsoleted by Adaptec's EZ SCSI kit, but I'm mentioning it in 	case someone already has these drivers.]  You can use the 	drivers in the Adaptec ASW-1410 kit (ASPI4DOS) and the ASW-410 	kit (ASPI CDROM drivers).  You will have to get a copy of 	MSCDEX.EXE (a high-level CDROM driver), if it is not included in 	the ASW-410 kit, but this is available from several bulletin 	boards.  * To use a SCSI tape drive with the 1542, you need software that knows   how to talk to a SCSI tape drive.  Software that I've heard about are   (again, like the above section on CDROM drives, I have no idea how   well the following solutions work, or even if they work -- the   following is secondhand information):       1. Central Point PC Tools 8.0 for MSDOS supposedly supports a large 	number of SCSI tape drives.  It comes with SCSI drivers 	(ASPI4DOS 3.1) as well as Central Point Backup.       2. The CorelSCSI! driver package contains a SCSI tape backup 	program (see the above section on CDROM drives for more 	details).  However, note that CorelSCSI! does not come with, but 	requires, ASPI4DOS.  * I've seen advertisements that sell the 1542 in three configurations:       1. 1542 SCSI controller with hard disk ROM BIOS.      2. 1542 SCSI controller w/BIOS and Adaptec ASPI drivers.      3. 1542 SCSI controller w/BIOS, Adaptec ASPI drivers, and 	CorelSCSI! drivers/programs.    I imagine that Adaptec now sells the 1542 in a fourth configuration:       4. 1542 SCSI controller w/BIOS and EZ SCSI drivers (including ASPI 	drivers).  * Those people who use Unix might be interested in a version of GNU tar   for MSDOS that talks to a SCSI tape drive via the ASPI4DOS driver (you   need this driver before you can use this program).  I've never used   this version of GNU tar, but I've heard that it works (I don't know   how well, though).  If you have anonymous ftp access to the Internet,   a copy can be found on wsmr-simtel20.army.mil and mirror sites:  	PD1:<MSDOS.DSKUTL> 	ASPIBIN.ZIP  67841 920131 Gnu Tar for SCSI tape drives, Adaptec 154xx 	ASPIPAT.ZIP  21206 920131 Patches for ASPIBIN relative to Gnu Tar 1.10 	ASPISRC.ZIP 221370 920131 Src for Gnu Tar for SCSI tape, Adaptec ctrlr    I have no idea if a copy can be found on Compuserve; UNIXFORUM might   have it, if any forum does.  * As far as MSDOS is concerned, the 1542A and the 1542B controllers are   the same; with MSDOS, the 1542A should work as well as the 1542B.   However, the hardware for these two boards is not 100% identical, and   there is at least one (NON-MSDOS) program that initially did not work   with a 1542A, but did work with a 1542B (BSD386 -- a 386 version of   BSD Unix).  * In case anyone's curious, here's an edited copy of my CONFIG.SYS file:  	FILES=40 	BUFFERS=40 	BREAK=ON 	STACKS=10,256 	DEVICE=c:\sys\dev\aspi4dos.sys /d /n4 	DEVICE=C:\QEMM\QEMM386.SYS on RAM ROM DMA=32 ST:M X=F800-FFFF 	DOS=HIGH,UMB 	DEVICEHIGH=c:\sys\dev\nnansi.sys 	DEVICEHIGH=C:\DOS\SETVER.EXE 	shell = c:\dos\command.com /p    Note that I'm using QEMM and ASPI4DOS 3.1.  If I were using ASPI4DOS   3.0 or 3.0a, I'd probably have to use a CONFIG.SYS that looked like:  	FILES=40 	BUFFERS=40 	BREAK=ON 	STACKS=10,256 	DEVICE=c:\sys\dev\aspi4dos.sys /d /n4 	DEVICE=C:\QEMM\QEMM386.SYS on RAM ROM DMA=32 ST:M X=F800-FFFF 	DOS=HIGH,UMB 	DEVICEHIGH=c:\sys\dev\scsiha.sys /V386 	DEVICEHIGH=c:\sys\dev\nnansi.sys 	DEVICEHIGH=C:\DOS\SETVER.EXE 	shell = c:\dos\command.com /p    If I weren't using ASPI4DOS, I'd probably use something that looked   like:  	FILES=40 	BUFFERS=40 	BREAK=ON 	STACKS=10,256 	DEVICE=c:\sys\dev\scsiha.sys /V386 	DEVICE=C:\QEMM\QEMM386.SYS on RAM ROM DB=32 DMA=32 ST:M X=F800-FFFF 	DOS=HIGH,UMB 	DEVICEHIGH=c:\sys\dev\nnansi.sys 	DEVICEHIGH=C:\DOS\SETVER.EXE 	shell = c:\dos\command.com /p    However, if I used a floppy-controller-based tape drive, or if I   planned to record high-quality sound from a sound card, I would still   need some way of changing the Adaptec's bus on/off times.  The first   two versions of CONFIG.SYS take care of this, but this last version   doesn't.  
0	I still only have one small problem with
them, and it is that the hardware cursor is slightly jumpy during writes/
reads to the swap file.  	The only GPF's I have ever had can be directly attributable to using/ abusing applications.  I even got the newest drivers from Diamond when  people started complaining.  I still only have one small problem with them, and it is that the hardware cursor is slightly jumpy during writes/ reads to the swap file.

1	Any and all comments will be appreciated!	I have a Colorado Jumbo back-up system at one of my places of  employment and it has eaten two tapes by winding the tape off the spool.  Is there an easy fix or is the tape drive fried? Does it simply need  cleaning?  Any and all comments will be appreciated!  Stephen Husak 
1	Some will with some motherboards.
	You will need to check with peripheral makers to see if their boards will work at 50 MHz.  Some will with some motherboards. 
1	Someone said that it really takes 3 clock cycles to
perform a transfer, so that reduces the transfer rate to 5.5MB/s,
which is the commonly-used figure for ISA bus speed.	Well, some quick math on my part shows that an 8.3MHz bus, 16 bits wide, performing a transfer every two clock cycles will provide 8.3M bytes/sec.  Someone said that it really takes 3 clock cycles to perform a transfer, so that reduces the transfer rate to 5.5MB/s, which is the commonly-used figure for ISA bus speed.  However, I believe a two-clock transfer is possible (0 wait states).

               Yes, that IS a '%' (percent sign) in my network address.	Diamond was helpful when I finally reached the "right" person in curing some of my Windows' problems due to an address conflict.  The conflicting addresses (2E0, 2E8) were OMITTED in at least my version of the Diamond/VRAM manual.  I hope it has been corrected by now.  The tech rep explained that ALL S3-based boards use these addresses.  I have not confirmed the validity of that statement.  When I upgrade my motherboard in the near future (hopefully with some form of local bus), I'll seek a video solution from someone other than Diamond.

0	Scrolls at 2/3
from the top of the windows.	When I use the terminal software for Windows such as TERMINAL.EXE or  Crossttalk, it doesn't use the whole window.  I mean, when the software's window size is max, it still scrolls around the 2/3 of window.  It does not use whole window.  I set "stty rows 30", but still the same. Scrolls at 2/3 from the top of the windows.  Could anyone tell me how to setup these software to use whole window?

1	Thanks,	I'm looking at purchasing some sort of backup solution.  After you read about my situation, I'd like your opinion.  Here's the scenario:  1.  There are two computers in the house.  One is a small 286 (40MB IDE drive).     The other is a 386DX (213 SCSI drive w/ Adaptec 1522 controller).  Both      systems have PC TOOLS and will use Central Point Backup as the backup /      restore program.  Both systems have 3.5" and 5.25" floppies.  2.  The computers are not networked (nor will they be anytime soon).  From what I have seen so far, there appear to be at least 4 possible solutions (I'm sure there are others I haven't thought about).  For these  options, I would appreciate hearing from anyone who has tried them or sees  any flaws (drive type X won't coexist with device Y, etc.) in my thinking  (I don't know very much about these beasts):  1.  Put 2.88MB floppy drives (or a combination drive) on each system.     Can someone supply cost and brand information?  What's a good brand?     What do the floppies themselves cost?   2.  Put an internal tape backup unit on the 386 using my SCSI adapter, and     continue to back up the 286 with floppies.  Again, can someone recommend a     few manufacturers?  The only brand I remember is Colorado Memories.  Any     happy or unhappy users (I know about the compression controversy)?    3.  Connect an external tape backup unit on the 386 using my SCSI adapter, and     (maybe?) connect it to the 286 somehow (any suggestions?)   4.  Install a Floptical drive in each machine.  Again, any gotcha's or      recommendations for manufacturers?    I appreciate your help.  You may either post or send me e-mail.  I will summarize all responses for the net.  Thanks,

messages that run off-screen, so I have to use the cursor/slider to read

Sometimes I get slightly wider messages that run off-screen, so I have to use the cursor/slider to read the whole thing.  I'm using NDW Deskedit mainly, but I've experienced the same prob with all other MS WIndows editors. I've fiddled with word wrap settings in the various editors, but to no avail. I know I'm missing something very basic in editor setup, but what is it?  Oh yeah, MS Word for Windows converts everything flawlessly but for what I'm looking for that's like using a tank to crack walnuts.  I'd really like to have an editor setup that would display all incoming ASCII files in a readable format to my screen.  Thanks in advance,

I can create a bunch of environment varibles from the DOS shell.	My problem is that on some of our machines (running MS-DOS 5.0 and Windows 3.1 in enhanced mode), the SET command in the BAT file fails with the OUT OF ENVIRONMENT SPACE error.  I have raised the amount of environment  space to 2048 bytes using the SHELL command in CONFIG.SYS so I know that I am nowhere near to running out.  If I just click on the MS-DOS icon, I can create a bunch of environment varibles from the DOS shell.  The problem is that on some machines, setting the value of an environment variable in a BAT file fails.  Has anyone seen such behavior before?  I see no place in the PIF fail to configure environment space.

PM is a Program _Launching_ utility not a file manager...	 	Hmmmm, why do I get the feeling that this is gonna start one of those endless threads 'Mac Vs Win" and might even end up as "OS/2 Vs Win". Well, I dont know if Windows is a mature OS, if I have seen one (in which case that has to be X-Windows :) ), but dont be so quick to judge...  First of all to try to use plain vanilla Windows is as courageous as to try to use plain vanilla DOS. There are _lots_ of very nice commercial and shareware packages/utilities that will boost up Windows past what MS itself thought possible :)... For example, Norton Desktop for Windows 2.0 (a replace- ment for ProgMan) will give you group-within-a-group capability and will even change group icons, it will launch progs by association (well, FileMan does that too) or by dragging the file in the apps icon (now Mac doesnt do that, huh? :) )...

Modify your  settings to have FM as your shell and not PM, or get a couple of utilities from cica that supposedly give you a 'Mac feel'... I dont wanna get in the discussion which is a better system: Mac's are good in their own way -- they are _different_ not better or worse than Win PCs-- (actually I am writing this from a Mac lab as a user assistant - so dont think I am partial to Win:) ) By all means check out the stuff in cica (ftp to ftp.cica.indiana.edu under the pub/pc/win3 subdir user: anonymous), or wait for StarTrek (Mac's OS on a PC !!! -- the threads we are gonna have then !!! :) )... Just trying to avoid another Mac-Win war...

0	Problems are:

	1) Sometimes I can't remember where the file is exactly located and it
would be nice to browse my directories for it without having to use the
file manager.		Basically, I have several DOS apps that I use now and then with different files.  They all accept a file as a command line  parameter, but the only way (at least that I know of) to do this easily when running them from windows is to set up the PIF file so that it prompts me for additional parameters (at which point I type  in the file name).    Problems are:  	1) Sometimes I can't remember where the file is exactly located and it would be nice to browse my directories for it without having to use the file manager. 	     and 2) I'm lazy and hate to type long pathnames for files burried  several directory levels deep.  	If anyone can point me to such a program or let me know of some other way to handle this, I'd appreciate it.  Thanks,  Tim --  	The Net isn't organized enough to be considered an anarchy
0	That is the full blown version, not an upgrade or educational version.	Well, someone at Microsoft told you wrong.  Windows will use a swap file larger than the recommended size.  Last summer I went to a Microsoft Windows 3.1 Technical Workshop and they distributed A LOT of information that the general public might not be aware of.  Anyway in the main book they handed out they have a section on "Creating larger than recommended swapfile".  I'll quote the information    If you create a permanent swapfile larger than the recommended size, you   will receive a message telling you that Windows will not use anything   larger than the recommended size.  THIS ERROR MESSAGE IS INCORRECT, we   will allow the use of the larger swapfile, up to four times the amount   of RAM on your machine.  So as you see, Microsoft does know that the information is incorrect.  You probably just ran into some doofball who was new on the job and was only telling you what little he knew.  Be that what it may, I would really suggest to everyone to take the opportunity to go to these Technical Workshops.  They aren't actually incredibly in-depth, but you do get a lot of material about bugs and optimization straight from those in the know.  Besides that they offer you HUGE discounts on software.  If I remember correctly, you could pick up Word 2.0, Excel 4.0, or whatever their presentation program is for $130. That is the full blown version, not an upgrade or educational version.  You could also pick up Microsoft Office for $500 or something like that.  Myself I sprang for Word.  Well, hope that was helpful to someone.  And besides that I hope someone will go to a workshop and save a little money.  And if anyone at Microsoft is reading this -- I really love your products. I need a job once I graduate also, can we work something out?  ;-)
0	Anyway, don't expect it soon.	Chicogo is what I want to use.  It is, like NT, a true OS with thrue  multitasking and multithreading, but has much smaller hardware requirements,  and does not meet DOD security specs (but that's okay since it will probably  be more of a client OS).  there are a few otehr differences, but those are the  main ones.  There was an article about Chicogo in PC Week last August. 	The Chicogo and NT development groups at Micro$oft are in intense  competition, so it is said.  However, I think a different relationship will  arise: NT will be the server (*N*etowrk *T*echonology), Chicogo will be the  client machine.  It is entirely possible for different OS's to work together,  partly because Chicogo is just a small NT (think of it that way, anyway).   (Novell Netware creates an OS on the server that is truly not DOS, so don't scorn the concept.) 	Anyway, don't expect it soon.  Windows 4 and DOS 7 are supposed to be  released next year (read: see it in 95), so I expect that Chicogo won't be out  til '96. 	With luck, I'll be proven wrong! =)  Rob

1	My best
guess is that the drive finds the first marker and then stops on the second
marker?	Did you open up the tape cartridge and put the tape back on the reels?  If you have not yet, open it up by removing the two screws on the bottom of the tape cartridge and snap the plastic shell away from the metal base.   As you are pulling the tape through the assembly try not to touch any more  than you have to.  As you are doing it, look for a couple of little holes in  the tape.  These are the marker holes which let the tape drive know when it is  at the end of the tape.  The holes are spaced a couple of inches apart.  My best guess is that the drive finds the first marker and then stops on the second marker?    Anyhow, If the tape has the holes, then check to see if the mirror on the tape is clean.  The function of the mirror is to detect the marker holes.  The tape drive shines a light at the mirror and has a pickup in the area where the reflection would come out.  When the hole goes by, the pickup detects the  light that was allowed to pass and it knows when to stop.  If the mirror is dirty or out of alighment (unlikely since it is made into the case) you might have a problem detecting the end of the tape.  If the tape drive does it on all tapes and the tapes all look good, then either the pickup or the LED of the sensor system has failed or is dirty.  If you open the drive door you will see the sensor assembly to the left of the R/W head assembly.  If it looks clean and nothing is in its way, then the drive may need to be serviced.  It is possible that the LED is burned out or the sensor is out.   If it is still in warranty, you might be able to send it back to CMS for repair.   --- Scott Hiles whiles@relay.nswc.navy.mil
1	Fixed disk
sectors are buffered by the controller, and transferring them to
memory with a 'rep insw' (or whatever the instruction is called) is
quite efficient (single instruction, goes as fast as the
controller/cpu know how to use the bus).	Actually, it does make a reasonable amount of sense. Fixed disk sectors are buffered by the controller, and transferring them to memory with a 'rep insw' (or whatever the instruction is called) is quite efficient (single instruction, goes as fast as the controller/cpu know how to use the bus). Since the 286 wasn't cached, the bus is likely a critical resource relative to CPU performance, and it's possible that DMA bus interference would cause as much or more loss of CPU cycles (for 'computing') as does the 'rep insw' sequence.  The floppy, on the other hand, is not buffered, so that using the CPU for floppy data transfer (as was done on the PC Jr, by the way) really does stink.
1	Why don't you start with the spec-sheet of the ISA bus first?	The Adaptec 1540-series use bus mastering.  This means that the CPU doesn't sit waiting for data bytes, it can go off and do other computing - if you have an advanced multi-tasking OS, that is.  DOS just sits and waits anyway.   Why don't you start with the spec-sheet of the ISA bus first? :-) IDE was designed to plug into ISA virtually unaided - in essence, IDE *is* ISA, on a ribbon cable.  Therefore it's specs are the same as ISA - 8MHz clock, 16 bit width, 5MB/sec.  This is why I've concluded that IDE on VL-bus is a waste of a fast slot.  The card's job would to slow the VL-bus transactions to ISA speed.  Heck, that's what ISA slots do - I'll just use one of those instead.

1	SCSI is used almost exclusively on these systems.	The Amiga Zorro II bus is comparable with the ISA bus (7.16 vs 8.33 MHZ). The Amiga has had a pre-emptative multi-tasking  OS since '85 and can operate with 1 MB RAM!  SCSI is used almost exclusively on these systems.  A SCSI controller that transfers data by DMA allows the cpu to request data from the hard drive and continue working while the controller gets the data and moves it to memory.  A controller that allows reselection can operate even better with multiple devices.  This is espically true with SCSI tape units.  For example, when rewinding or formatting a tape, the command is issued to the controller and the bus is released to allow access to other devices on the bus.  This greatly increases productivity or, at least, do something else while backing up your hard drive :-).  Which happens to be what I am doing while reading this group.  Its a long story, but I still use IDE on my 486 except for the CDROM which, thanks to SCSI, I can move between both machines.  If, and when, SCSI is better standardized and supported on the ibm-clone machines, I plan to completely get rid of IDE. --   Wayne Summer        //        AMIGA - Simply the Best.   Palm Bay, FL.

0	But, whatever, the cause, it is working now.	I don't think there is any correlation between the crashes and PCTools. I reinstalled Ami Pro, and ran compress again, with no problems. I think problems may have been related to filling my disk until it had 0 bytes (!) left while FTPing, although I would think it wouldn't matter since Ami Pro wasn't running at the time, and I made space available immediately anyways. But, whatever, the cause, it is working now.

0	If you
haven't, call Microsoft and I'm sure they'd be happy to send you some!	VC++ *is* considered an upgrade for C7.  There will be no product called C 8.0 (although the command-line compiler of VC++ lists its version as 8.00).  C7 is not a "DOS"-only product -- it is a C/C++ compiler capable of producing executables for DOS or Windows, as is VC++ (Pro. Ed.).  The (significant) difference is that VC++ comes with many Windows-hosted tools (ide, etc) which assist developers in creating Windows executables much more quickly (basically by automating the thousands of lines of boilerplate code).  Initial impressions have been very favorable.  Everyone who is a registered user of C7 should have received a considerable amount of info regarding the specifics of C7. If you haven't, call Microsoft and I'm sure they'd be happy to send you some!

We installed Paradox for Windows, (but I don't think  Paradox is the real problem here), and the installation went ok (windows is installed on a local drive, paradox installed on a novell network (netware 386 v3.26 or greater), DOS 5, Win 3.1) but the program will not load in 386 enchanted mode.

0	Their benchmarking technique is seriously flawed, as was clearly shown
    by the Graphite and #9GXE's "cheating".	Two things that annoyed me about the PC Magazine review:  1.  Their benchmarking technique is seriously flawed, as was clearly shown     by the Graphite and #9GXE's "cheating".  Can't they just admit that     their benchmark is to easy to optimize for and/or cheat on?  WinTach     is much harder to beat...  2.  The big "cheat" that Hercules/IIT used was overlappipping BitBlit and     PolyLine optimization, and Hercules sent them a new driver which didn't     do this -- but produced almost identical scores.  Yet, the only thing     PC Magazine says is that scores are not "legitimate" -- couldn't they     at least make some comment about its real-world performance?  I'm not so much going by WinBench for performance, but, rather, by Steve Gibson's results, which are more real-world based (like using Micrografx      "Despite these documented cheats, I have to say that in real-world      applications the Hercules Graphite adapter actually draws faster than      any other display adapter in the industry.   [...]  Even though it's      just a modest ISA bus card, it outperformed every local bus adapter I      have, including the Stealth 24 VLB, the Fahrenheit 1280VA/VLB, the      ATI VLB Mach32 and even the Weitek P9000-based Diamond Viper VLB."  This kind of praise is enough for me to be interested in it, bogus WinBench or not!  :)   I already returned the ATI GU+.  My dealer had sold eight of them, and  seven were returned to him.  I'm now (temporarily) back to running an original ATI GU, until I get my Graphite.  And, yes, the GU is faster in my 16 MB system than the GU+, especially in bitmap handling (that's where you use BitBlits).  Hercules has a promotion available for VARs and software developers: you can buy one Graphite or Graphite VLB for 50% off list to try it out.

0	---	I can't say anything about other bus mice, but with the Mouse Systems one you'll have to give up either COM2 or LPT2 to an IRQ. Also, if you don't know, Mouse Systems mice have three buttons. The driver includes a utility that lets you assign keystrokes to the middle button.  Hope this helps someone else. If you're anywhere near as frustrated as I was, it's well worth the $80.  ---

	I agree that the image is as sharp as it gets with these SONY tubes, however in the 17" monitors using these tubes, the 2 annoying black lines on the top and bottom quarters of the tube, which are created due to the wires holding up the Invar Shadow Mask, are quite annoying after a while.  That is the only thing that is making me lean more in favor of the NEC 5FG (or now also available the NEC 5FGe - only difference, no ACCUCOLOR ).  Any experiences or opinions from people who have used the NEC 5FG would be appreciated since I want to get one right after my exams are all done (ie: about a week from now).  -Tony

0	The problem is in the
owner-draw menu code somewhere-- if you comment out that section, all
other pieces of ctrltest work fine.	I have never gotten the _entire_ ctrltest app to run under BC++, but the reason is that MS makes some bad assumptions about the order in which static/global objects are initialized (i.e. some objects are getting accessed before they are initialized).  The problem is in the owner-draw menu code somewhere-- if you comment out that section, all other pieces of ctrltest work fine.  Two other major gotchas I have found using MFC under BC++:  - The CFile::OpenFlags enum uses hard-coded numbers for the open mode,   rather than the manifest constants defined in fcntrl.h (which differ   between MSC and BC).  - All of the MFC collection classes depend on another bad C++   assumption-- that a reference to a base object can used be in place   of a reference to a derived object (true for pointers, NOT for   references).  I am sure there are other problems along the same lines, but I have not encountered them (yet).  I have not seen MFC 2.0 yet, but I hope that some of these will be addressed.  If they are not, all of MS's hype about portability to other vendor's compilers will be just that.

1	If you find out I'd like to know also.	    I've started to notice the same thing myself. I'm running DOS 5 and Win 3.1 so I can fix it from the Windows Control Panel.

Oh, and I also leave my system running all the time.                                                                     
1	If
you're really interested, though, take a look at the text file
P9000RES.DAT, which holds the data from which the choices in the
P9000 monitor installation program are built.	This is not the case: the ROM on the P9000 supports VESA modes of up to 1024x768 in 256 colors.  VESA-compliant applications should have no trouble setting these modes. (But I'm forwarding your posting to our Software group, just in case.  Can't be too careful.)  Not that I doubt that YOUR applications are failing to run; lots of stuff depends on figuring out which exact SVGA they're looking at, and don't use VESA calls (VESA is still pretty new). Every new chip set confuses them.   I think we go to AT LEAST 76 Hz at 1024x768x8, and maybe more (and it's a function of the RAMDAC speed, not the Power 9000). We need to fix the problems you've noted (they were already on the list).  If you're really interested, though, take a look at the text file P9000RES.DAT, which holds the data from which the choices in the P9000 monitor installation program are built.  Working by analogy, you can build up a new monitor definition that has the right combinations of refresh rates for your monitors.  Keep a backup copy of the file!  Once you've built a new version of the P9000RES.DAT file, run the P9000 installation program, INST, and your new choices should show up.  (This assumes you have the WEITEK v. 2.2 drivers. You can tell the rev number by looking at the modification time of the driver: 02:20 is version 2.20.  Microsoft uses this gimmick, too.)   The SPEEDY benchmark was put out by Hercules and IIT, who to my knowledge were unencumbered by any motivations except making the Hercules Graphite/IIT AGX014 card look really good.  So I'd take the numbers with a ton of salt. (Texas Instruments did the same thing with WINTACH, trying to make the 34020 look good compared to the 8514, as if anyone cared.)  It's safer (though not safe) to use benchmarks from "unbiased" sources, such as testing labs, columnists, etc.    I think you'll a large discrepancy between the results of SPEEDY and the results of anything else in the universe on these things.   Font caching is a perfectly legitimate optimization -- Windows has hooks for it built right into the GDI.  What's kind of silly is IIT's use of a hardwired "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog then sat on a tack" string in their driver.  Not only is it useless in real applications, it lacks the programming elegance of the "Bart Simpson optimization," in which you save the bitmap of the most-recently drawn string in off-screen memory, and just do a screen-to-screen bitblit if you happen to be given that same string a second time in a row.  (We call it the "Bart Simpson optimization" because Bart's the only person we can see benefiting from it: he could right "I will not cheat on benchmarks" a hundred times and be done in half the time it would take to actually form each character.)   We don't have any lawyers -- they're all working for Intel.  There used to be a lawyer in Montana who didn't, but he died.  	-- Robert

1	That setting only allows you to set
the *boot order* of the floppy A: with respect to the primary HD C:,
i.e., check A: first, then C: or check C:, then A:.
	 I hate to burst your bubble but you cannot "slip in a B:" to that particular AMI BIOS setting. That setting only allows you to set the *boot order* of the floppy A: with respect to the primary HD C:, i.e., check A: first, then C: or check C:, then A:. 
1	So, when you've got multi-tasking, you want to increase performance by
increasing the amount of overlapping you do.	There is a way in which a multi-tasking computer actually gives you more CPU power then you had before, and that is with I/O overlap. With I/O overlap, your CPU can continue to "think" while disk operations are underway, whereas without overlap, your CPU sits idly waiting for each disk operation to finish - and disk operations take an *eternity*, compared to a fast CPU.  So, when you've got multi-tasking, you want to increase performance by increasing the amount of overlapping you do.  One way is with DMA or bus mastering.  Either of these make it possible for I/O devices to move their data into and out of memory without interrupting the CPU.  The alternative is for the CPU to move the data.  There are several SCSI interface cards that allow DMA and bus mastering.  IDE, however, is defined by the standard AT interface created for the IBM PC AT, which requires the CPU to move all the data bytes, with no DMA.
1	Avoid.	CTX 14": Nasty, low quality. Avoid.  CTX 15" Proscan: Not as good as some other makes; however, cheap.   Main problem seems poor quality control. Some reported pincushioning   (the problem I had), others poor focus, etc, etc.  I complained about mine and it was 're-tuned' (I dodn't even pay shipping) and returned to me in 2 days.   It's now clear, well-focussed and has no pincushioning or barrel distortion at all. I'm very happy with it, and the digital controls and mode memory are nice. Certainly, a Trinitron (say) would be much nicer, but that's well out of my price range.  Conclusion: If you're on a budget, get one and be prepared to send it back if it's not perfect. It probably won't be when you get it, but has good potential.

0	You can get around the problem by adjusting the parameter OutlineThreshold
in the [TrueType] section of WIN.INI.	This is a common problem with highly complex TrueType fonts.  Microsoft admits to a problem with older versions of the PostScript printer driver, but I've found it to be pretty generic.  You can get around the problem by adjusting the parameter OutlineThreshold in the [TrueType] section of WIN.INI.  This entry specifies the number of pels-per-em at which Windows will render TrueType fonts as outline fonts instead of as bitmap fonts.  The default is 256.  I've generally been able to get fonts to work by setting OutlineThreshold=160.  Depending on your printer resolution and the point size you are using, you may need a different value.  The Windows Resource Kit warns against going above 300.  Presumably, that might cause fonts to print as square boxes or something.  :-|  (I'm not smiling.)

1	This eliminates ambaguity.	Ok once again with the SCSI spec list: SCSI-1 {with a SCSI-1 controler chip} synchronous range is indeed 0-5MB/s  asynchronous range is slower at 0-3MB/s. SCSI-1 {With a SCSI-2 controller chip}: 4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst {8-bit}  Note the INCREASE in SPEED, the Mac Quadra uses this version of SCSI-1  so it DOES exist. Some PCs use this set up too.  SCSI-2 {8-bit/SCSI-1 mode}:          4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst {for those who want SCSI-2 but don't want to pay for the 16-bit or 32-bit  hardware or mess with the SCSI-2 software controllers.  Usable by SCSI-1  devices with close to 8-bit SCSI-2 speeds} SCSI-2 {16-bit/wide or fast mode}:  8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst SCSI-2 {32-bit/wide AND fast}:     15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst  On the other interfaces let DXB132@psuvm.psu.edu speak: Again synchronous and asynchronous modes with asynchronous much slower  {Range 0-5MB/s}  One problem is the inconsitant use of the term 'SCSI' in articles and by people.  Its PROPER meaning is "The set of SCSI interfaces composed of SCSI-1 AND SCSI-2" Look at the inconsitant use of SCSI in the below quote: (My comments in {})  PC Magazine April 27, 1993:29 "Although SCSI is twice as fast as ESDI, {This is asynchronous SCSI-1 with a SCSI-1 chip} 20% faster than IDE..." {this is BOTH asynchronous SCSI-1 with a SCSI-2 chip AND 8-bit SCSI-2} To read CONSITANTLY the quote SHOULD read: {asynchronous SCSI-1 with a SCSI-1 chip} "Although asynchronous SCSI-1 is twice as fast as ESDI, one third the  speed of IDE..." or {asynchronous SCSI-1 with a SCSI-2 chip or 8-bit SCSI-2} "Although SCSI-1 with a SCSI-2 chip and 8-bit SCSI-2 are eight times as fast as ESDI, 20% faster than IDE..."  NOTE the NONUSE of 'SCSI' by itself.  This eliminates ambaguity.  SCSI-1 drivers are somewhat reasonable while 16-bit and 32-bit SCSI-2 drivers  are VERY expansive {8-bit SCSI-2 can use SCSI-1 drivers with little speed degridation(the Mac Quadra does EXACTLY this.)}
0	In short, virtually
every board manufacturer cheats on the test by writing things in the
driver that is there only to make the board appear faster on the
WinBench suite.	And why they are considering using WinBench as a test, they may want to read everything Steve Gibson has said on the subject in his InfoWorld column the past couple of month.  In short, virtually every board manufacturer cheats on the test by writing things in the driver that is there only to make the board appear faster on the WinBench suite.  So the WinBench score has no bearing in reality to how cards stack up on real world tasks.  In the last PC-Magazine they benchmarked some of the new accelerators, and admitted that many of them 'cheated' on WinBench.  Interestingly, they 'allowed' one type of cheating behaviour (caching for bitblt operations, no matter how unreal), yet did not allow a couple of other types of cheating behaviour that some of the cards used.  At least one card was eliminated from the "Editor's Choice" because of cheating on the benchmark.
1	A note to add is that there is no exact
configuration for these in my current bios, but it seems to work at a
setting 17 (977 cyl 5 head, 300 write_pre, 977 landing zone).	The first drive is currently formatted to Tandy Dos v3.3 but I am eventually going to upgrade both to MS Dos v 5.0  The drives themselves are both model number WD95044-A circa 5-07-1991 They are 782 cyl 4 head drives.  A note to add is that there is no exact configuration for these in my current bios, but it seems to work at a setting 17 (977 cyl 5 head, 300 write_pre, 977 landing zone). There are three pairs of jumper pins on the back that I presume are for setting up the master/slave.  Originally, the drive in the machine had none.  Currently, I was suggested to try the far right (looking at the back) for master and the middle jumper for the slave.  When booted, the reinitialize seems to puke accessing the d: drive.  It does flicker about three times on the second drive, but then gives the error.   Hopefully the problem is as simple as the drive not being formatted, but not being a person who has ever had to actual format and unformatted drive, I would not even know how to do that.  Any and all help on this is great fully appreciated.  If not, a number for Western Digital might just do as good!  swood

The problem came when I try to (bring up excel or if excel is running and right in the middle of it - like click a selection with the mouse) from the desktop. First of all, I always get the application error screen followed by another application error screen with various different messages. The following are some of them:  - Stack fault, by TC1024.DRV at address 0001:XXXX where XXXX is some   number. (TC1024.DRV is the VGA driver provided by the manufacture) - General protection fault, by ndw.exe at the same address - Segment load failure, by ndw.exe at same address  Some how, the address flagged was always 0001:something. What is address 0001:XXXX means?   I have absolutely on idea what this mean. I tried commented out the TSR programs from autoexec.bat, no help.  Is it something to do with the emm386 setup which is not telling WIN31 what it suppose to know. Looks like the application is crossing memory boundary when it is being loaded or while it is running.  Please reply if you have any idea or suggestion. I'm willing to try anything. 
1	You wouldn't believe how slow the news is on this 
system.   	When we use NCSA FTP to send from the Gateway with hash turned on, we see 4 hash marks immediately.  Then the computer  r e a l l y  drags.  If we turn  off the internal cache of the 486, the speed is better, but doesn't match the speed when we receive to the Gateway.  It doesn't matter if we send from the Gateway or get to it: 4 hash marks and  then extreme slowness if the cache is not disabled.  Does anyone know any more about this?  Is there a fix?  The Gateway was purchased in June, 1992.  Please respond directly.  You wouldn't believe how slow the news is on this  system.

There is explicitly NO WARRANTY that the given settings are correct or harmless. (I only collect, I do not check for myself!!!). There is always the possibility that the settings may destroy your hardware! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   Since I hope however that only well-minded people undergo the effort of posting their settings the chance of applicability exists. If you should agree or disagree with some setting, let me know immediately in order to update the list.  If you possess a HD not mentioned here of which you know BIOS and/or jumper settings, please mail them to me for the next update of the list!  Only IDE (AT-Bus) Harddisks will be accounted for. If not specified the Landing Zone should be set equal to the number of cylinders. If not specified the 'Write Precompensation' should be set 65535. (There are BIOSes that don't even ask for it).  Another statement (maybe right): IDE harddisk don't have Precomp and LZone. The precomp is a built-in parameter and lzone isn't used because most if not every IDE disk has autopark.  The jumpers' names are given as printed on the HD's board, often only a jumper number (JP12 means the jumper '12'). A zero means that the jumper is left open, a one means that the jumper is closed.    ***************************   C O N N E R   ***************************   		Conner Peripherals Drive Geometry  IDE/AT  Conner drives are low level formatted at the factory.

I a single drive environment the drive is described as a Master.    In a dual drive environment the drives are described as a Master and a Slave. This is due to the protocal the takes place between the two drives  when performing diagnostics.    There are four links, LK1, LK2, LK4 and LK5, adjacent to the 40 way  interface connector. They have the following functions and are described  in order as viewed from the end of the drive, with the first jumper  described nearest the 40 way interface connector.  LK2: LED       When fitted, this jumper connects the LED drive to pin 39 of the      interface. This allows a LED to be connected to the interface. An      external current limiting resistor needs to be fitted in series with      the LED when this option is selected. The value of the resistor will      be dependant on the LED type chosen but will be in the range of 130      Ohms ot 220 Ohms.  LK1: Dual Drives      This jumper must be fitted when two drives are attached to a single      bus. It fallows communication across the 40 way interface connector,      indicating, to the Master drive, the presence of a Slave.  LK4: Master      When fitted this signifies that the drive jumpered is a Master. If      there are two drives connected on a single bus then only one may be      jumpered in this way.  LK5: IOChRdy      When fitted this connects the IOChRdy signal to the drive, it is       fitted when the drive is used in host systems that have a higher      data transfer rate than the drive i.e. greater than 4 MBytes per      second when using 1:1 interleave. This jumper is not normally       fitted as most hosts transfer at a lower rate than 4 MBytes per      second.     There are four possible Master/Slave configurations in which a drive(s) may be jumpered:       Master, single drive with LED on interface		LK2 & LK4 fitted.      Master, single drive without LED on interface	LK4 only fitted.      Master, dual drive without LED on interface	LK4 & LK1 fitted.      Slave, dual drive without LED on interface		No jumpers fitted.      Master, dual drive with LED on interface		LK4, LK1 & LK2 fitted.      Slave, dual drive with LED on interface		LK2 only fitted.     The Master drive will delay power-up for approximately two seconds to reduce power surges in applications where dual drives are used.     The other connections for a LED will be found close to the 28 way  connector at the other end of the drive. This LED driver is not affected by the link options. An internal current limiting resistor is on the  drive for this LED driver. Refer to the product specification for further details.     ***************************   S E A G A T E   *************************  There is a list of most Seagate HD (including MFM, SCSI, ESDIand IDE) on every Simtel mirror under  /msdos/dskutl/1seagate.zip  It contains info about the following drives:  	    st1144a	st138a	    st274a	st3283a st1057a     st1156a	st1400a     st280a	st351ax st1090a     st1162a	st1401a     st3051a	st9051a st1102a     st1186a	st1480a     st3096a	st9077a st1111a     st1201a	st157a	    st3120a	st9096a st1126a     st1239a	st2274a     st3144a	st9144a st1133a     st125a	st2383a     st325ax   *********************	T E A C   **************  Model: SD-3105                  Cyls.

mouse, and sometimes just when I am sitting there.	I thought this problem might have something to do with Windows 3.1 SMARTDRV and a VESA video card...any ideas???  I recently purchased a 486DX-33 machine and am having problems where the  machine will suddenly freeze or reboot.  This may happen in Windows 3.1 or DOS  5.0.  Sometimes it is after printing a document, sometimes after using the  mouse, and sometimes just when I am sitting there.  Twice when it happened, the  machine rebooted and sounded seven beeps.  I looked in the documentation and  the seven beep code meant a problem with interrupts.  The machine has the  following configuration and files:  486DX-33 AMI BIOS 5.25 and 3.5 floppies 170 Meg IDE hard drive 256k cache Microsoft compatible mouse on com1 Citizen GSX-145 on lpt1 NI SuperVGA Monitor with VESA Windows Accelerator Card w/ 1Meg Two VESA slots Windows 3.1 DOS 5.0  CONFIG.SYS ========== DEVICE=C:\WINDOWS\HIMEM.SYS DOS=HIGH DEVICEHIGH=C:\DOS\SETVER.EXE FILES=20 BUFFERS=20 STACKS=9,128  AUTOEXEC.BAT ============ @ECHO OFF LH C:\WINDOWS\SMARTDRV.EXE 1024 PROMPT $p$g PATH C:\DOS;C:\WINDOWS;C:\MOUSE LH C:\MOUSE\MOUSE SET TEMP=C:\DOS LH C:\DOS\DOSKEY    When the machine freezes, I can't use the mouse or keyboard or use Ctrl-Alt-Del  to reboot.  If any one can give me any help, I would greatly appreciate it.  If  anyone can help configure this machine for the best efficiency (memory wise) I  would appreciate that also. --  Douglas B.

one could run character-based apps, but graphics-based apps will have
to be shared by running the executables on the local CPU.	Since running any GUI over a network is going to slow it down by a fair amount, I expect Windows NT will be multiuser only in the sense of sharing filesystems. Someone will likely write a telnetd for it so one could run character-based apps, but graphics-based apps will have to be shared by running the executables on the local CPU. This is how things are shaping up everywhere: client-server architectures are taking over from the old cpu-terminal setups.   Note that the NeXT does this: you can always telnet into a NeXT and run character-based apps but you can't run the GUI. (Yeah, I know about X-Windows, just haven't been too impressed by it...)..       -- 
1	How would this
number compare if I bought the state-of-the-art SCSI card for my ISA PC, and
the state-of-the-art SCSI hard drive (the wailing-est system I could hope for)?	[Tons of stuff deleted on SCSI vs. IDE question...]  Wow, you guys are really going wild on this IDE vs. SCSI thing, and I think it's great!  Like lots of people, I'd really like to increase my data transfer rate from the hard drive.  Right now I have a 15ms 210Mb IDE drive (Seagate 1239A), and what I would say is a standard (not special, no cache I believe) IDE controller card on my ISA 486-50.  I'm currently thinking about adding another HD, in the 300Mb to 500Mb range. And I'm thinking hard (you should hear those gears a-grinding in my head) about buying a SCSI drive (SCSI for the future benefit).  I believe I'm getting something like 890Kb/sec transfer right now (according to NU).  How would this number compare if I bought the state-of-the-art SCSI card for my ISA PC, and the state-of-the-art SCSI hard drive (the wailing-est system I could hope for)? Obviously money factors into this choice as well as any other, but what would YOU want to use on your ISA system? And how much would it cost?  Along those lines, what kind of transfer rate could I see with my IDE HD's if I were to buy the top-of-the-line IDE caching controller for my 200Mb, 15ms HD? And how much would it cost?  I actually have a PAS-16, and could (what a waste I guess it would be...) hook up a SCSI HD through it's SCSI port which yields an optimum of 690Kb/sec. Actually, I have a borrowed 12ms Fujitsu HD hooked up through it now (and own the Trantor HD drivers for the PAS-16 SCSI port).  Is this SCSI port a SCSI-2 port?  How could I tell?  Is the Fujitsu 2623A a SCSI-2?  Are all SCSI HD's SCSI-2?  Thanks for any comments on these rephrased questions.

If you specify the environment size in a PIF file for COMMAND.COM, the PIF setting overrides this setting.  The default is 0 with MSDOS versions earlier than 3.2.  Otherwise, the default value is the /e: option in the SHELL= command in CONFIG.SYS.  To set this value, you must edit your SYSTEM.INI [and reboot]."   I have used this entry, as well as relied on the default /e: from the CONFIG.SYS shell= line, and both give larger environments.  If you don't use one of these, then the environment passed by windows to each new DOS box is just a little bit bigger than the environment _variables_ present when windows was started.  (No matter how big the DOS env was, when windows starts, it truncates all unused space except for a few bytes.)  This should allow your batch file to run, but your mileage may vary.

0	Has anybody heard of such a driver?	Since I do not own a SoundBlaster: is there a possibility to use the PC Speaker driver to play audio files for the VideoBlaster (.AVI = audio video interleave files) ?  I think what I should have is a device driver for the Media Player that controls the PC Speaker Driver instead of the SoundBlaster card (something like MCISPKR.DRV).  Has anybody heard of such a driver? Or am I on the wrong track?  Any information on this appreciated!  (Please send e-mail, since I don't watch this group regularly.) 
1	I'm willing to speculate that the DX2-50 with local-bus will be 2-4 times 
as fast as the DX-50 and probably as expensive (or cheap ;-)!	I saw a posting about the choice between 80486DX-50 and a 80486DX2-50. I was wondering: although a DX-50 is faster because of the path to it's external cache, shouldn't the choice be the DX2-50 as that one can be made to work properly with a local-bus? I mean, cache speed is one thing, but all your speed will be blocked during video I/O, so just get that faster...  I'm willing to speculate that the DX2-50 with local-bus will be 2-4 times  as fast as the DX-50 and probably as expensive (or cheap ;-)!
0	Is there anyone familiar with NDW who can tell me how to turn it off??	I would like to know how to STOP or uninstall this program!!  I have taken it out of win.ini, but it still pops up running with windows. I did a big search and found reference to it in ndw.ini, system.ini and progman.ini.

1	The DX2 only has the internal 8k cache to work with at 50MHz, while the DX 
has a potentially much larger cache to work at 50MHz with.	Andrew, yes there is a DX and DX2 version of the 50MHz 486.  If you are  considering buying one or the other, definitely go for the DX with a nice  size external cache!  The performance is far greater.  The DX2 only has the internal 8k cache to work with at 50MHz, while the DX  has a potentially much larger cache to work at 50MHz with.  Neither  systems could actually run a program out of main memory, since DRAM is  still too slow for that high of bus speed ( 60ns = 16.66MHz < 50MHz ).  -rdd  ---  . WinQwk 2.0b#0 .

1	My ATI Ultra Plus can handle that, given 2MB
of memory.		The one thing that I was puzzled by was why there was not a 1024x768x32k color mode on the thing, either in full screen or enlarged desktop mode.  My ATI Ultra Plus can handle that, given 2MB of memory.  All the 2MB buys you on the Fahrenheit is 1280x1024x256. Just ONE more mode.  GEEZ.  Had I known, I wouldn't have bothered.  I asked them why, and all I got was "Your point is well taken, but Orchid's software developers are busy with other projects."  	So, to get to the point, finally, ARE there any s3 86c805 drivers out there that can handle high res hicolor modes?  I'd love to get another card, but perhaps it will have to wait until the next generation of cards comes out, since this card came bundled with my system and it's not so easy to exchange these things unless they're broken.  	If you want these modes, steer away from Orchids s3 86c805 cards (ie. VLB or VA/VLB), at least until their developers are "less busy".  If the magazines are to believed, I've only seen one s3 86c805 product thus far which can handle 1024x768x32k color (Genoa?), although evenn that might be a misprint.  	Please, if there are generic or semi-generic drivers out there, let me know where I can get them.  800x600x32k is OK, but I coulda gotten that with my ATI VGA Wonder XL.
0	WSM is currently looking for persons willing to devote the time to author
columns within WSM.	WSM is a compilation of submissions from shareware/freeware authors in a single Windows .HLP (Help System) file.  All types of software may be submitted for entry in WSM - utilities, applications, games, programming tools, etc.  WSM benefits Windows shareware/freeware authors by allowing them to publicize their software releases, inform users of updated versions, and to increase their installed base of users.  Those searching for specific Windows software will benefit by having a complete list of available software available at their fingertips - complete with feature lists, current prices, and any other relevant information.  Windows software authors may submit entries to Windows Shareware Monthly in the following manner:  1. Compose a short summary of the function of the software.  Include all    special features which are unique to your product and which set it apart    from other programs in the genre.  Be sure to include specific details    such as: the current release version, where the software is available,    how much the registration fee costs, how much disk space is required, any    special requirements (e.g. sound card, or VBRUN200.DLL, etc.), how the    author may be contacted, etc.  Because text is highly compressible, the    summary may be as long as is necessary, however, it is best to keep it    short.  A good guideline is a single screenful of 12-point text at 640x480    resolution.  Order forms and other such addendum may be included if desired.    All submissions whould be in plain text (ASCII) format.  Formatting will    be exactly as it is submitted - I will simply cut and paste text files    into a Help Authoring system.  If you require special formatting     conventions - such as boldface text or italics, or a larger font size,    indicate so CLEARLY within the text file.  For best results, use Windows    NotePad to create the .TXT file.    2. Include up to 100k of Windows-format .BMP (bitmap) screen-shots which    display the workings or special features of each program.  Special cases    (rendering applications for example) which require 256-color bitmaps may    submit up to 250k of .BMP files - all other should observe the 100k limit    and use 16-color format.  For maximum compatiblity with the software which    will be used to create the WSM .HLP file (Stefan Olson's Help Writer's    Assistant for Windows), please save the bitmaps with Windows Paintbrush or    WinGIF.   3. Include a 16-color .BMP of the program's icon (.ICO file).  Many programs    are available to convert .ICO to .BMP format, or Windows Paintbrush may be    used.  The .BMP will be embedded in the summary text.  4. Double-check for spelling errors, formatting corrections, etc.    5. Compress the .TXT file, the .BMP of the program icon, and any additional    .BMPs into a single file using PKZIP (any version).  6. Submit the entry by UUENCODING the .ZIPfile, and e-mailing it to:        DAA7365@TAMUTS.TAMU.EDU     if submitting via the Internet or Compuserve. If submitting via America    Online, send a brief message indicating submission, and append the .ZIP    file, then e-mail to:     DiegoAA  7. If any changes are required, or a new version is released, complete    the above procedures again.  Send all submissions to the @TAMUTS address,    and any comments, suggestions, criticisms, to DAA7365@RIGEL.TAMU.EDU.  All entries received before the deadline will be included in the subsequent edition of WSM.  The editor will not be held responsible for any errors, and we reserve the right to make changes to the entries.  WSM is not limited to shareware/freeware software.  A special area will be devoted to commercially available Windows 3.x and NT software.  Commercial software authors should follow the same steps above, with the exception of the limitations on size - the .TXT file and .BMPs may be as large as required (and as large as is practical for transmission over phone lines).  There is no charge for the publishing of either shareware/freeware or commercial product entries.    Advertisements for computer hardware, software, bulletin boards, etc. may be submitted as well. Again, the same procedures apply, with the exception of the size limitations.  There is no charge for advertising space.  The first ten advertisements submitted each month will be included; subsequent submissions will not be included due to size constraints.  WSM is currently looking for persons willing to devote the time to author columns within WSM.  A C/C++ programing section, a Visual Basic section, and two Windows-specific opinion/advice columns are envisioned.  All work will be on a voluntary basis.  If you wish to aid WSM and author a monthly column on one of the above topics, please send us mail at DAA7365@TAMUTS.TAMU.EDU or DiegoAA on America Online.

0	I'll stop now ;-).	I currently have Novell Netware Lite which does not work with Windows very well and is a conventional memory hog (ver. 1.1). I am considering moving all our machines to W4WG.  Q1:  How much conventional ram does W4WG use over and above the      driver for the network card?  Q2:  If I have a Novell NE2000 card, are the LSL and IPX drivers      still needed?  Q3:  Does W4WG do a license check over the network to ensure each      machine is running its own licenced copy of W4WG? (Note: I do      not want to break the license agreement and I will buy a copy      of W4WG for each of our machines, it is just that I would like      to try it out first to see if it meets our needs. Returning one      opened copy is much easier than returning N opened copies.)  Q4:  If you buy the upgrade to Windows 3.1 for W4WG does it replace      all of Win 3.1 as you install it or does it depend on current      Win 3.1 files?  Q5:  If I install Windows NT on my server when it comes out, will I have      any troubles with the W4WG machines?  When I started this message, I was going to ask only 2 questions but I got carried away. I'll stop now ;-).  I look forward to your replies.  Al 
0	The beta version, although being
slow, botts up much faster than my SUN workstation.	It certainly is multi-user. What I have seen from the March Beta is that it doesn't yet come with the stuff which exploits multi-user features. I remember somebody from MS stating that it doesn't allow two users share one GUI. My interpretation of this was that one user per console but all the networking and RPC based stuff you want.   I believe ftp and rlogin deamons for NT systems will come from third party. Somebody already has a Beta version of an unsecure ftpd on the net. There is no reason why one cannot write a posix based shell like csh on Unix for remote logins.   In general I liked NT when I checked it out. It slow compared to Win3.1 (just like any other real OS). The beta version, although being slow, botts up much faster than my SUN workstation. Windows subsystems also start up a lot faster than X windows. I believe Bill Gates was right when he stated that NT was not for everybody. After playing around with it for a while I was convinced. If I owned a busines using a "business computer" from IBM or some other established vendor, I would consider moving to NT platform because it would provide a much cheaper solution (If you are running SQL servers etc.). It provides the robustness such an application requires.   On the other hand if you like your DOS games, more or less forget about NT. You can always boot to DOS  but in general that defeats the purpose of using NT. Most of NT's features are visible in a networked environment and in such an environment you can't reboot your machine at will. For personal use, I would rather wait for the Win32 based Windows release (whatever you name it) than jump to NT bandwagon. I expect most applications will keep on using Win16 until Win32 becomes widely available.  
1	-Douglas
	My detective work has shown that this jumper simply connects/disconnects the BALE line on the 64-pin part of the ISA bus.  The question I have is simple: To those people who own this revision of the Speedstar 24X, what does the manual claim that this jumper does?  To anyone with an ISA-reference, what is the function of the BALE line?  On a related note: Are there any FTP sites which contain a descriptive reference to the ISA bus?  My motherboard manual has a simple pin-to-signal-name chart, but that is it.  -Douglas

check that out?	 Many motherboards have jumpers to enable/disable the memory banks.  Did you  check that out?
1	As far as I know, the "speed buffering"
works OK for external modems if a 550 is used on the internal serial
port board.	However, I can tell you to stay clear of any board which uses the Rockwell MPU (as opposed to the DPU) for an internal implementation. This is because the MPU used "speed buffering" instead of having a 16550 interface.  Without the 550 interface, the number of interrupts are still the same and thus may get dropped under multitasking conditions (like in windows).  As far as I know, the "speed buffering" works OK for external modems if a 550 is used on the internal serial port board.  Hope this helps... Tom

1	All of these
have DIFFERENT SPEEDS and COSTS.	Nice of you to DELETE BOTH YOUR responce and the item that prompted it. to whit:                                       ^^^ To which YOU responded: To which I correctly pointed out the following:                          As I said this is sloppy and DUMB {YOU should resounded by DISCOUNTING the Mac NOT giving "Maxtor 245 meg IDE drive for $320" example.  By giving an example you give the IMPLIED consent that for MAC info to be INCLUDED in the SCSI discusion.}  Ok I will do this V E R Y  S L O W L Y so you can understand REGUARDLESS of whether it is a Mac or a PC SCSI-1 and SCSI-2 are DIFFERENT from each other as is asynchronous and synchronous SCSI-1.  All of these have DIFFERENT SPEEDS and COSTS. Lumping them all together as 'SCSI' is dumb and sloppy.  Take again the quote later on as an example of the problem  in the PC world {The spec list was so that you knew where the numbers were coming from in the article.  It shows the article is CORRECT in it staments about SCSI but not CONSITANT}.  With the way this thread has gone how do you tell :-). Already GAVE them.  YOU keep deleting them! So here are the Specs on everybody AGAIN {With some added info}:  SCSI-1 {SCSI-1 controler chip} asynchronous range: 0-3MB/s  synchronous range: 0-5MB/s  Both common to the PC world; difference is  mainly in software not hardware.  SCSI-1 {SCSI-2 controller chip; also called SCSI-2 (8-bit)}: 4-6MB/s with  10MB/s burst.  This is advertised as SCSI-2 in BYTE 4/93:159 FOR the  PC and AT THESE SPEEDS.{NOT the Mac, the PC.}  {I have not seen the following for EITHER the Mac or the PC} SCSI-2 {16-bit/wide or fast mode}:  8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst SCSI-2 {32-bit/wide AND fast}:     15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst  On the other interfaces let DXB132@psuvm.psu.edu speak:  asynchronous range: 0-5MB/s {infered from BYTE 4/93:159}  synchronous range: 0-8.3MB/s.  Note that I ALSO give the AVERAGE through put for SCSI-2 which holds true a Mac OR IBM/PC clone with the correct hardware and software. And since PC ADVERSIZEMENTS are using Theoretical performance figures WHY  CANNOT WE?   With PC articles like the following it is obvious that the problem is NOT with SCSI but with the PEOPLE WHO REPORT IT! {Like YOU.} Look at the inconsitant use of SCSI in the below quote:  (My comments in {}) "Although SCSI is twice as fast as ESDI,{This is asynchronous SCSI-1 with a SCSI-1 chip} 20% faster than IDE..." {this is BOTH asynchronous SCSI-1 with  a SCSI-2 chip AND 8-bit SCSI-2} PC Magazine April 27, 1993:29 The ARTICLE is confused, NOT SCSI.  The TERM is a mess from inconsitant use NOT because the interface itself is a mess.  SCSI means "The set of SCSI interfaces composed of SCSI-1 AND SCSI-2" NOT 'SCSI-1' as some people want to use it.  To read CONSITANTLY the quote SHOULD read: {asynchronous SCSI-1 with a SCSI-1 chip} "Although asynchronous SCSI-1 is twice as fast as ESDI, one third the  speed of IDE..." or {asynchronous SCSI-1 with a SCSI-2 chip or 8-bit SCSI-2} "Although SCSI-1 with a SCSI-2 chip and 8-bit SCSI-2 are eight times as fast as ESDI, 20% faster than IDE..."  NOTE the NONUSE of 'SCSI' by itself.  This eliminates ambaguity.

get you coming and going).	These questions can be answered by any dealer of IBM Value Points, but, I will provide some unsolicited advice -- the most amusing kind of advice.  Today (Tueday 4-6-93) IBM is supposed to officially announce the introduction of the VESA Local Bus Value Point systems.  These systems still have on-board video and disk which are far better than the prior Value Point systems, and you get VESA Local Bus for (future?) upgrades.  We are going to buy three of them with 17" monitors (also a newly available), and one of the three will immediately be upgraded to UltraStor 34F caching SCSI disk controller and either the ATI GUP or the Viper graphics board.  Do not buy a 486SX sytem.  My personal philosophy on upgrade policy is that it is not loss-free.  When you earn money you pay taxes, when you spend money you pay taxes.  (i.e. they get you coming and going).  Translated this means take infrequent but large steps.  You are far better off short term AND long term if you avoid the SX models and go straight to the DX or DX-2 models.
0	Maybe its just me.	1)  I was wondering, are the programs that are packaged with the Office Pack--WinWord, Power Point, Excel, and ccMail--complete and the latest addition?  2) Are the programs "hobbled" in any way?   3) Can we update single programs at a latter date ( i.e. from Excel 4.0 to Excel 5) ?  4) Do you receive all of the necessary disks and documentation?  5) Is there anything that I should be aware of that makes the Office Package less of deal that it seems?  Sorry if I seem skeptical put the price for the Office Package--$439.39 on the street--sounds like a great deal for the office that is purchasing its first computer and software.

	  Zapp 1.1 from Inmark   Zinc 3.5 from Zinc software   C++/Views from Liant   Win++ from Blaise  Some considerations I'm using:    Being new to Windows programming (I'm from the UNIX/X world), the quality and intuitivness of the abstraction that these class libraries provide is very  important.  However, since I'm not adverse to learning the internals of Windows programming, the new programming methodology should be closely aligned with the native one.  I don't believe arbitrary levels of abstraction, just for the sake of changing the API, are valuable.    Since we will be developing for the 32bit Windows NT system the memory management issues and issues particular to the Windows 3.1 API are less important.     We will probably buy another C++ class library (something like Tools.h++ or Booch components from Rational) to handle data structures and other miscellaneous stuff  (allocators etc...).  So those features are not that important for this toolkit to have.  The two that I have narrowed it down to are ZApp and Zinc, they seem to be the two toolkits that have received the most attention from the media.  I was wondering if anyone had any first-hand experience with any of these toolkits (especially ZApp and Zinc).  A couple of observations about these toolkits that seem particularly noteworthy are:  ZApp ----   Seems to have the most extensive coverage of Windows functionality and     also includes some other miscellaneous useful classes.   Has new fancy 3D-style controls available, and support for custom controls.   Has a Windows NT version (Essential)   Redirectable graphics display/output architecture (useful for printing)   Sizer class for automatically managing control layout after resize.   Seems to be the newcomer, this could be an advantage in designing a better system.   Zinc ----   Has a platform independent resource strategy.  (Not too important for me right now)   Comes with a interface builder tool   Has a Windows NT version (Essential)   Seems to have been around longer (more mature), but grew up out of a DOS version.     Had a better demo :-)  Both have source code availability options Both are lacking OLE support Neither seem to have any particular support for multimedia type stuff   Any thoughts anyone has on this would be much appreciated,  Thanks,   Brett Harper

0	The key issue that I bought my BJ-200 on was ink drying speed.	        All right.  Not saying I know any more than the average salesguy, I'll give  your question a shot.   The key issue that I bought my BJ-200 on was ink drying speed.  You really  have to try awful hard to get the BJ-200 ink to smear.  The HP DeskJets need  10-15 seconds to completely dry.  In both cases, however, do not get your  pages wet.  Unlike laser printers, the material on your pages is INK, not  toner.  But that should go without saying.  My PC has very little memory (only 2Meg RAM), so the BJ-200 takes a little  while to print ----- but every application I use takes a while to run.  Once  the computer is solely printing, it purs like a kitten and puts pages out  every 15-30 seconds, depending on how detailed your graphics are.    The BJ-200 can do Windows soft fonts.  I'm assuming that the DeskJet can, or  HP wouldn't sell many......  Size is another factor.  The BJ-200 is much smaller, but the HP is built  like a tank.  I bet the BJ-200 would get damaged first.  Finally, the print quality.  I LOVE the BJ-200's resolution.  It looks like  a good laser quality print.  The HP's I've used.....they look like ink.  Not  as impressive.  
1	This is how you can sometimes use
"slower" RAM in a machine.	Your machine will run at whatever the bus is jumpered to/CMOS is set to (usually wait states) regardless of what speed RAM is installed.  No motherboard can sense the speed of the RAM installed, unless you call failing as a sort of auto-sense.  This is how you can sometimes use "slower" RAM in a machine.  You either set the number of wait states to accomodate the slow RAM (in which case, all memory will run at that slower rate) or you reduce the wait states and take the chance that the slower RAM will act like faster RAM and you won't crash.  Putting faster RAM in won't speed things up unless you tell the machine it has faster RAM.    Mixing fast and slow RAM will not help you if you have to keep the bus  slowed down to accomodate slow RAM.

0	However, this is the
exception.	re: What to do after the high speed modem arrives.       Edition 01 Apr 93  This article applies only to Windows 3.0 and 3.1, and not to NT, OS/2 or DOS apps not running under Windows.  One of the unadvertised limitations of most current Windows PCs is that their RS-232C (serial, COM) performance is seriously deficient.  Almost everyone who purchases a high-speed modem (V.32bis, V.32, PEP or HST) discovers the problem the first time they try to download a file or accept an incoming FAX (at 9600+) after upgrading the modem.  Overrun and retry errors abound, even when the only active application is the datacomm or FAX program.  If the transfer completes at all, it may take even longer than with the old 2400bps modem.   There are three reasons for the problem:  1. The Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitters (UARTs) used in most    PCs are primitive Ns8250 devices with single-byte FIFO buffers.  If the    operating system/driver cannot read and flush each character at high    interrupt rates, the next incoming character overwrites the FIFO and    the previous one is lost.  DOS, being a fairly single-minded    environment during datacomm, can usually keep up. Windows can't.  2. Windows has more operating system overhead than plain DOS, and    interrupts often take longer to service.  Overruns are much more likely    than under DOS.  As soon as you report to your PC/modem vendor that you    are losing data, you may be advised that "you need to upgrade to a    16550". More likely, since there seems to be a conspiracy of ignorance    about this issue,  you'll get no useful advice at all.  Most of the    store-front and mail-order sources I spoke with in attempting to solve    my own problem had never heard the term "16550" and many didn't even    know what a UART was.  3. Even your PC has Ns16550A UARTs (and PS/2's do), or if you can upgrade    your mother/COM board or add a new COM board, you may STILL experience    errors and overruns because the standard MicroSoft Windows COM drivers    don't take full advantage of the 16550.  Windows 3.1 is improved in this    regard over 3.0, but I still recommend a driver upgrade.  Applications    like ProComm+/Win (which is what I use) cannot get around this problem    by themselves.  If you have a modem CARD, you may not have a problem, as the modem part of the card can be designed to be aware of the state of the UART, and avoid overrunning it; however, I wouldn't want to bet that the card designers were that clever, and will insist on a 16550 UART if I ever buy a modem card.  Some modem cards don't even have conventional UARTs, but if they are to work with standard Windows drivers, they need to simulate one. Use MSD.EXE (below) to see what the modem card is, or is pretending to be.   The Hardware Situation.  The UARTs on most PC COM ports are based on National Semiconductor Ns8250 or Ns16450 chips (or megacells inside VLSI chips where you can't replace them).  You can ID the UART type on your system by running the MicroSoft diagnostic program \WINDOWS\MSD.EXE.  Be sure to run it in DOS *before* bringing up Windows.   The Windows serial API may prevent MSD from accurately identifying a 16550 if you run it from a Windows DOS prompt.  The Ns16550 UART has separate 16-byte transmit and receive FIFOs with configurable trigger levels, and can run reliably at clock rates up to 460,800 bps, although with current modem technology, there's no point in pushing your luck by going over 115,200 bps. The 16550 has shorted access cycle times than the 16450 or 8250.  The 16550 also has DMA capability, but it is not clear that any PC drivers ever use this.  For more technical info, see National Semiconductor Application Note AN-491.  So, what UART component do you have?  Try to locate the UART on your mother board, multi-function I/O card, COM board or ISA/MCA modem card.  If you can't find a socketed component with the numbers "8250" or "16450", your COM ports are probably buried in VLSI, and you won't be able to perform a chip replacement.  If you can DISABLE your VLSI COM ports (as I chose to do), you can at least add an aftermarket COM board.  If you have one or more socketed 8250 or 16450 chips, you can buy plug-in Ns16550AFN or PC16C550CN (low power CMOS version) ICs from several suppliers typically for $9 to $15 each.  The "N" chip is the normal 40-pin dual-in-line package.  Other styles are available, but avoid any Ns16550 chips without the "A" (the 16C550C are presumably all OK).  Early Ns chips have bugs, although National will reportedly exchange those of their own manufacture for free.  Clone chips are available from various IC makers other than National.  The manual for the TurboCom drivers states support for the following (apparently equivalent) chips: National Semiconductor: 16550A, 16551, 16552 Chips&Technology:       82C607 Texas Instruments:      t16c550a Silicon Systems:        73M550 VLSI                    16C550 TurboCom warns about the pre-"A" Ns16550 and Western Digital 16C550, says that problems have been reported with early IBM PS/2 55SX and 70 systems (IBM reportedly will upgrade them).  If you DON'T have socketed 8250/16450 chips, you'll need to buy an after- market COM or multi-function board. If this is a modem card situation, you may be hosed. To add a new COM or multi-function card, you'll need to either disable the COM1/2 port(s) you are replacing, or re-assign them to COM3/4 (although watch out for IRQ conflicts without TurboCom).  Although cheaper cards are available, in the interest of getting the problem solved quickly I elected buy the Modular Circuit Technology MCT-AIO+ card from:  JDR Microdevices 2233 Samaritan Drive San Jose  CA  95124 (800) 538-5000 voice US (408) 559-1200 voice other (800) 538-5005 FAX US  The MCT-AIO+ (and the "+" is important) sells for $89.95.  It is an 8-bit ISA card providing:  Port Type  Connector  Address and IRQ        Comments COM        DB9M       COM 1,2,3 IRQ 2,3,4,5  Ns16550AFN in socket COM        ribbon     COM 2,3,4 IRQ 2,3,4,5  Ns16550AFN in socket Parallel   DB25F      LPT1,2,3  IRQ 5,7 Game       ribbon  The kit includes a ribbon cable and DB25F connector for the secondary COM port, a ribbon cable/connector for the game port, two bulkhead plates for the ribbon-based connectors and a 9F-to-25F adaptor cable.  Each port can be individually disabled, and the COM ports have TX, RX, RTS, CTS, DTR, DCD, and DSR jumpers.  JDR also sells a Super-I/O m-f card that also has IDE.  I have heard from several people about less expensive m-f I/O cards with 16550s:  TSD Systems (407) 331-9130 $19.95 for the card, plus $9.95 per 16550.  Greenfield Trading and Distributors (518) 271-2473 (voice), (518) 271-7811(FAX). Their card is $33 w/one 16550, $45 w/2, and they sell 16550AFNs for $13.  R&S DATA SYSTEMS, INC. 820 East Highway 434 Longwood, FL  32750 PHONE: (407) 331-1424 FAX: (407) 331-8606 2COM/LPT/Game card w/2 16550s for $39  I have no personal experience with any of the firms except JDR.  Meanwhile, back at the MCT card from JDR... I only needed two serial ports, and am running out of IRQs on my PC, so I disabled my built-in VLSI-based 8250 ports. However, with the TurboCom driver (below), I could have set the internals as COM3 and 4, using IRQ sharing.   The Software Situation  Simply upgrading to 16550 UARTs will not completely solve common overrun problems.  The standard MS serial drivers don't take full advantage of the 16550. The Windows 3.0 drivers are even less capable, and the Windows 3.1 drivers have the following limitations:  - They enable only the receive FIFO, and only at rates above 2400 bps.  - They never enable the transmit FIFO, which  results in an interrupt    rate of 10x during uploads.  - They set the trigger level at 14 bytes (too high - it's easy for 2    more bytes to arrive before the driver can read the FIFO).  - The Ports menu of the Control Panel only allows speeds up to 19200.    With a V.32bis modem,  sparse data and text can easily compress 3:1    or more, suggesting that a host DTE connect rate of 57,600 bps would    be effective.  - The API won't accept rates above "CBR_128000".  - The API won't let DOS programs know there is a 16550 there, and even    if it did, DOS programs that aren't 16550-aware get little benefit    from a 16550 port with the standard drivers.  - They don't allow IRQ sharing for COM3,4.  - The BIOS doesn't initialize COM3,4 properly in many systems.  - Windows provides no workaround for apps that don't provide port    speed options above 19200 bps.  These problems are reportedly NOT solved in Windows NT or DOS 6.0, and may or may not be addressed in any Windows releases after 3.1 (but before 4.0). Rumors suggest they "may" be solved in Windows "4.0".  You can get replacement drivers that solve all of those problems by buying a copy of "TurboCom", current version 1.2, from:  Bio-Engineering Research Pacific CommWare Division 180 Beacon Hill Lane Ashland  OR   97520-9701 (503) 482-2744 voice (503) 482-2627 FAX (503) 482-2633 BBS MCImail:    344-5374 CompuServe: 71521,760  Price was around $50 as I recall.  Bio-Eng is not set up to accept credit cards, so I had to send a check.  Egghead and 1-800-Software list TurboCom but as far as I know, they don't stock it.  Bio is not a software company per se.  They apparently needed reliable hi-speed serial connections for an in-house instrument application, wrote their own driver, discovered a market for it, revised it to be a general purpose COM driver suite. They recently upgraded it for Windows 3.1.  It is run-time licensed.  I now have my host (DTE) connect rate set to 57,600 bps most of  my datacomm apps, and I am having ZERO problems with downloads. I routinely see transfer rates that exceed 2,000 bps. I am also using 115,200 bps when linking an HP95LX to my PC, with lossless bi-directional I/O. Uploads to various remote systems are another matter, because many hosts are still using antique UARTs and drivers.  Note that 19200 is still the highest rate that the Windows 3.1 Port menu in Control Panel will allow in configuring a COM port.  TurboCom gets around this by allowing you to specify, on each port, a factor that will set the real UART rate to a multiple of the rate passed through the Windows APIs and dialog boxes.  I also have CTS/RTS hardware flow control enabled, and I suggest that you do the same.  Even if you only ever transfer 7-bit ASCII data, Xon/XOff is not a sufficiently reliable method of flow control.  The informal (DEC) standard for Xon/Xoff hysteresis is that the sender may transmit another 16 (yes, sixteen) bytes after receipt of the Xoff from the receiving system or device.  The 16 byte FIFO in the 16550 is clearly not big enough to let us rely exclusively on Xon/Xoff.  A well-respected datacomm engineer has informed me that the 16550's can't really do CTS/RTS all by itself in the DOS/Windows environment, so using data rates above 115,200 may still be risky.  Even with hardware flow control, a 16550 with TurboCom can still experience overruns in very busy systems, with lots of apps running and serious swapping in progress. If this is your situation, you may need to buy a co-processed COM board, but this will cost you more than a 16550/TurboCom upgrade.  A review of two such boards, and a review of TurboCom, can be found in the Feb'93 issue of "Windows Sources" magazine. I suggest trying a 16550/TurboCom upgrade first, and experiment with process priorities and time slices if you are a "power user" whose thrashing system still runs into comm problems.   Closing Soapbox Comments  The state of RS-232C serial datacomm support is an embarrassment across the computer industry.  Because it is the oldest standard I/O interface, the job of designing hardware and writing software often seems to be assigned to the least senior or lowest ranked engineers at computer companies.  The design of the average serial port is at least ten years behind the state of the art. In my last job, with a major workstation vendor, I lobbied for improved serial ports when they were doing the initial designs of a new system.  That family of machines was subsequently introduced with 16550 ports.  However, this is the exception.  Few computer companies seem to have any champions for decent I/O.  You may as well learn what you can about serial I/O, because this situation shows no sign of improving soon.  When V.FAST arrives, I expect cries of outrage from Windows users world-wide whose 8250 PCs "sort of" work today with V.32, but will fail miserably with V.FAST.  Without a hardware-buffered UART (like the 16550) and without software drivers that use that UART to best advantage, a V.FAST modem will be a waste of money.

1	Look forward to configuring the system optimally
yourself.
	I recently bought a Leading Edge 80386DX-33 <mini tower case> and everything works fine. Leading Edge seems to be a decent brand and what-not. I would tend to say that it is a decent deal. The only things you might want to be wary about is that my L.E. computer has a back-plane mounted motherboard. Ie: The motherboard itself is a card that can be plugged in to a backplane. Some people don't like these configurations. The second thing is that whoever set up my computer at the factory didn't really know what they were doing. The installed windows video driver didn't even take advantage of the SVGA card/Monitor. Look forward to configuring the system optimally yourself. 
1	But with DRDOS6, this advantage is gone,
because DRDOS lets you choose in config.sys which drivers should be loaded.	 mouse.com could be started from the commandline after the booting and it could - perhaps - be unloaded, if no other driver is loaded after it. The working of both drivers is totally the same.  When I ran dos, I preferred loading most of the drivers in autoexec.bat, because some programs won't run with some drivers and I could choose the ones I needed during startup. But with DRDOS6, this advantage is gone, because DRDOS lets you choose in config.sys which drivers should be loaded.  Michael

1	Are the compression and
defragmentation routines good enough to consider the upgrade if I don't have
those routines already (as opposed to buying them separately)?	I'm new to these groups and so please forgive me if my questions are frequently asked, but I don't know the answer :) I've been recently having some problems with my 386 computer with a Seagate 40 meg hard drive. I occasionally find corrupted files, but most of the time programs work fine. Are there any utilities that are easily available that can help me determine whether or not the problem is a result of the hard drive vs an ill-behaved program or some other hardware item? Are there utilites to determine whether or not the hard drive is properly aligned etc? As might be expected, I would greatly appreciate any help on this matter. I'm considering just reformatting the disk and reinstalling everything (and hoping that will fix the problem), but I would like to have some assurance of what the problem cause is.   Also, can someone give me an opinion on DOS 6.0? Are the compression and defragmentation routines good enough to consider the upgrade if I don't have those routines already (as opposed to buying them separately)?    Much thanks in advance for any help.

1	What do the benchmarks look
like?	 Windows: The recent reviews have all shown that the P9000 cards are 	 significantly faster doing Windows than the ATI card.  VGA:	 The recent reviews have all shown that the P9000 cards they looked 	 at are significantly slower doing VGA than the ATI card.  About 	 1/2 the speed, as I recall.  	 The big question for me is the Orchid V9000 card.  Each of the  	 P9000 cards tested so far has had the W5186 to do VGA.  Orchid 	 is the only one I know about (I don't know about AMI) that uses 	 the W5286 for VGA.  That is reportedly faster. 	  	 I would like to know whether the Orchid card can do VGA as fast as 	 the ATI card.  If so, it would appear to be a formidable competitor. 	 (Advertised prices are about the same for the two cards.)  Someone in this group posted a little while back that they were getting an Orchid V9000 card -- has that card arrived?  What do the benchmarks look like?  Also, is the AMI P9000-based card real?  What does it use for VGA?  Speed?

PROBLEM enters.  The DARN serial ports have no selection for  COM settings, they are stuck on 3 and 4.   Good card for HD's and FD's but lousy for serial.   I called Microsoft and other places.  The long and short of it is WINDOWS wants com1 and 2 ONLY!, for mouse selection. I went out and bought a small I/O card just for parrelel and serial. Now I have ALL 4 active COM ports and LPT1 and LPT2. This Half card was less than $20.  Mouse on COM 1  external modem on COM 2,  I disabled the LPT2 so I could use the interupt for my scanner card IRQ. C-ya..... /\/\artin

1	It should work.	The speaker connector should have two wires going to the speaker.  A speaker being a coil, it's bidirectional and makes no difference which way you attach.  Turbo switch.   There are three wires to control how you want turbo to become active- with the switch pushed in or the switch out.    I think the middle wire is common.   Use an ohm meter to figure out which wire connects with the common wire when the switch is pushed in, and which two wires are connected when the switch is out.   Place the appropriate two wires on the turbo berg connector of the motherboard.  LED's:   (Turbo and HD)  LED's are uni directional.  Depending which way the wires are attached the LED will not light.  On my AMI motherboard, if the turbo switch wires are not attached to the berg connector on the board, the board will power up in default in Turbo mode.   If your motherboard is like that... just attace the LED wires to the board.  If the LED doesn't light, power off, reverse the connectors and try again.   It should work.  If it does, then attach the turbo switch to the board.  Hope this helps.
1	This is a bit long.		I have a similar configuration: Colorado 250mb on 66 DX/2 tower.    	You got suckered in the same way I did.  Silly me, believing 	that the "250" logo on the front meant actual carrying capacity. 	The people who do this sort of thing for a living call it  	"marketing."  Lawyers who prosecute it call it "fraud." 	Perhaps we can have a bunch of other duped buyers march on  	their corporate headquarters.   	This is a bit long.  My system takes about 45 minutes to do  	the same thing.  Usually 4.5 hours, particularly if the tape  	is grinding away the whole time means that your block size for  	the write is too small.  Is there any way to change the block  	size or write buffer size so it's bigger?   	This is because the files are opened by DOS.  The files in the  	TAPE directory are likely the executable file or the configuration 	file for the tape system.  I would recommend running the backup 	from DOS so it will make a complete backup of the TAPE directory.   	The 250mb cartridges won't do you any good since the drive 	won't write 250mb of physical data on the tape.

1	IDE are
installed first and then when the scsi bios runs it will try to install
as the next drive.	There is a simple answer.  If my memory serves me the scsi bios will only work as the first or second drive.  Any "built-in" drives e.g. IDE are installed first and then when the scsi bios runs it will try to install as the next drive.  But if there are already two drives, then no can do.  The solution is simple: use the aspi4dos device driver and disable the scsi bios (as it is useless in your case).  It works like a champ!  I have seen a similar situation before.  Good Luck

I can use 640x480 at 72hz, 24-bit and 800x600 at 70hz, 24-bit, all non-interlaced.    They aren't perfect, but are much improved.  I don't recall the last time which I had to leave mach 32 mode (ATI GUP mode) and switch to 8514 or VGA mode due to software incompatibility.    It's quite fast, but whether or not its the fastest is open to debate.    I like it. 
1	Citibank VISA requires no pre-registration.	I am just about to post the results of my big computer purchase.  One of the key points was the ability to use my American Express card.  I  read the fine print between double warranty policies of Amex and Citibank VISA.  Sure, both will allow you double warranty on computers, but Citibank has a maximum claim of $250.00.  Could you imagine trying to get your monitor or mother board fixed for $250.00?  Amex has NO limit on claims.  Remember, if you use Amex, you must either send a copy of the warranty info to them in 30 days from purchase, or you must call them to pre-register and then send them the paperwork within 90 days of purchase (my pre-register pak arrived today).  Citibank VISA requires no pre-registration.

	Currently it gets so hot that I can not hold a finger on it for more than 0.5 s.   I keep a big fan blowing on it, but am considering using a heat sink.  Any advice?  
1	I am lost here.	The system boots up if the Tandberg is disconnected from the system, and of course no SCSI devices found (I have no other SCSI devices).  The system boots up if the Seagate MFM controller is removed from the system. The Future Domain card reports finding the Tandberg 3660 on the SCSI bus. The system then of course stops booting because my MFM hard disks can't be found.  The system hangs if all three (Tandberg, Future Domain TMC-1660 & Seagate MFM controller) are in the system.   Looks like there is some conflict between the Seagate and Future Domain card. But the funny thing is that it only hangs if the Tandberg is connected.  I have checked that there are no conflict in BIOS addresses, IRQ & I/O port. Have I missed anything?  I am lost here. Any suggestions are most welcomed. Thanks in advance.  Delman.    -- ______________________________________________________________________
1	AHHHUUUURRRRRRGGGGGHHHH!!!!	I bought a Maxtor 4380 300mb ESDI HDD from Hi-Tech for $300, then paid to get it repaired, for about another $300.  Here's the deal:  The thing works fine!  It low level formats, etc without any bad spots at all!  AND THEN... (Jaws Music) sectors start going bad!  EEK!!!  One at a time.  Norton disk doctor keeps marking some U and some C.  That FIXES it.  For about 5 minutes.  Then next day when I run NDD on it again: NO DICE more uncorrectable and correctable sectors.  AHHHHHUUUURRRRRRGGGGGHHHHH!!!!!  So I fugure: "Ok, NDD's just not being thurough enough, I'll use Spinrite, I heard that works well." What happens?  Spinrite goes and returns the clusters to active use!!!   AHHHUUUURRRRRRGGGGGHHHH!!!!  NDD undoes it of course.  The problem seams to be getting worse and worse.  HOWEVER when the HDD is low level formatted again the problem goes away for a while, only to return in a day or so.  I'm so pissed off right now I'm considering buying another HDD, and I really can't afford it.  I'm using SMARTDRIVE, and WINDOWS 3.1 (I'm not using the 32 bit disk access though, I know that can create problems).  The disk is using the second option to trick the controller into thinking it's got less then 1024 cyls, and everything else selected is standard, maybe I need to use a different head skew or something?  I don't know.  ANYONE WHO KNOWS HOW TO FIX THIS PROBLEM PLEASE TELL ME HOW!!!! HELP!!!!

1	--	I read a recent article in Personal Computer World mainly about the new digit audion formats (DCC and MD) but at the end talked about how nice it would be to use these for data storage with a brief calculation of how much data you could store. The author had been talking to someone from Sony about these formats and mentioned this to get the reply "MD is a purely audio format, we wouldn't use it for data", then when pressed for info about MO the Sony man basically admitted that it was no more than a slight adaptabtion on MD!  What I think the original poster was wanting was MO drives at MD audio player prices. I'd assume that the problem here is that an MD system can have higher tolerances than an MO system as the ear doesn't pick up the occasional bit error as well as an archiving program!  --

0	The 486 will more or less act as server with
a report/check printer attached to it.	The particular need in this case is for three machines, each in a different office of the same building, each having access to a Windows-based accounting system.  My first thought is to set up MS Windows for Workgroups on each of the machines (likely a 486 and two 386's) along with the appropriate Ethernet cards and cabling that come with the Windows for Workgroups starter kit (one additional user kit will be necessary).  It then seems logical to purchase a simple multi-user accounting system, along the lines of DacEasy or M.Y.O.B., and fire it all up!  The 486 will more or less act as server with a report/check printer attached to it. Cable runs of 30-40 feet will be necessary for this setup.  Well, this all seems too easy to me.  Would any of you network gurus out there tell me if I am out of my mind here?  Any and all suggestions, however trivial, will be immensely appreciated.

0	If you have a SoundBlaster Pro, it should support IRQ10 as well.	I don't believe IRQ5 is the problem. I tried a mouse on COM3, IRQ4 (the usual place) and it still did not like it. Simply, Windows seems to only support mice on COM1 or COM2. The funny part is, though, that Microsoft's own mouse driver (8.xx) was quite happy with my mouse sitting on COM3. Why can't Windows use the mouse driver, or at least support COM3? :-)   I've tried this too. Actually, I wanted to be able to use my second modem (COM3/IRQ5) from Windows. It still will not talk to that modem. I created two profiles, AMSTRAD (for my Amstrad modem on COM1/IRQ4) and MAESTRO (for my Maestro on COM3/IRQ5). It will not talk to the Maestro at all.   Nor here. (Windows 3.0).   I've seen nothing like that. I've experimented with Logitech's mouse driver too, with no sucess.   If you have a SoundBlaster Pro, it should support IRQ10 as well. Finally, a board that supports IRQs >9. The only one I have (except my IDE controller).  hamish

1	(Now if it just KEEPS working).	   Upon unboxing it I found everything to be in perfect order. All the  peripherals I ordered were properly installed (Jumbo-250 & CD-ROM). I was very impressed with the quantity and quality of the Gateway  documentation. All software came with the original disks and manuals. The Gateway manual itself is in a nice 3-ring binder. The ATI GUP came with build59 drivers. All other software I specified (Microsoft Office) was properly installed. The machine came right up out of the box and  has been performing flawlessly. It's been on all weekend and it hardly even reaches room temperature. I think the big roomy tower case has a  lot to do with it.      It's up and running DOS 6.0 with no problems. I've also read about some people having problems with high speed serial communications.  I used the DOS 6.0 InterLink program which lets me link to my old computer via a serial port at 115.2K baud. It then "maps" the other machines two hard disks as my disks F & G. You can "cd" to these drives and either run programs or copy files. It's almost like a peer-peer lan except you can also *run* programs on the other machine. It's not a two way street. The other machine is the server and this machine is the client. So thats where it seems to differ from the  peer to peer stuff. For a bundled DOS utility its very impressive.     My Jumbo-250 took about 11 minutes to back up 117MB of data. I also by-passed any potential Gateway monitor problems by taking the $430 credit and applying it towards a NEC 4FG. I love this monitor!    So, I'm glad there is some good news Gateway stories and I'm glad it was me. (Now if it just KEEPS working). :-)   					John

	I think it's simply because DOS doesn't use the IRQ for anything. OS/2 does, so with that you can't share the IRQ.  Anssi

From what I've heard (pure hearsay) the results of outputting    TT fonts as Type 1 is _not_ as good as using high-quality Type 1 fonts in    the first place.  Unless you `print' to file with the correct resolution set for the final output device (image setter).  A problem with TT fonts in Windows is that they do get converted to T1 format OK, and the hinting is even used while this is done, but the resulting T1 fonts are NOT hinted.  The result is that they WILL work fine on a device of the resolution assumed by the printer driver when the PS file is generated, but they will not look good when printed at a different resolution.

I thought it     uses NDIS.                                                                                                                                                My problem is that Lan Workplace with all its drivers uses up most of my     UMBs, so I'd hate to have to load many more drivers to make W4WG work        along.                                                                                                                                                  I read in a German computer magazine that TCP/IP support for W4WG is just   around the corner. Anybody have any news about this?

0	As I noted before, if you can afford the space on the hard disk, and
don't do much in the way of customization, reinstalling from one
directory to another may be less arduous.	 No, we're not.  But we're also not going to promote pandering to corporate paranoia when the real issue is convenience.  I don't *like* dealing with floppies.  Personally, I have no use for changing the registration info, but I see it as a valid need, and one that ought to be solved using a quick little utility rather than a half-hour reinstall that's just about guaranteed to mess up your settings in one way or another.  So, while I'm not going to put much time into it myself, here's the procedure for getting on your way to finding the encoded information:  1.  Copy all your Windows disks into the directory from which you want to install it.  I've been using c:\WINSTALL myself.  2.  From there, copy that directory to something like c:\WINORIG.  3.  Install from c:\winstall.  4.  comp the two directories to determine changes.       i.e., comp *.* \winorig\*.* >\report.txt  5.  Look in the report file for the file(s) that change.  Assuming they didn't cover themselves covering their own tracks, at least one file should have a difference noted at a particular offset.  Locate said offset in the original directory and see what's there using a hex editor, and do the same for the modified one.  6.  You're on your own as far as breaking the code goes; I don't really do cryptography.  It's probably just an xor key or something; I think MS is more concerned with Joe Schmoe at the office personalizing his copy than with "real pirates" who will probably just disassemble the damned thing anyway.  This technique should work with just about any obnoxious corporate product that tries to write to the original floppies when you install; in some extreme cases you may not be able to back the floppies up to hard disk, and will be stuck doing a compare on floppies (Lotus stuff is probably like that).  As I noted before, if you can afford the space on the hard disk, and don't do much in the way of customization, reinstalling from one directory to another may be less arduous.  Doing some of the stuff I've mentioned here may well void your license with Microsoft, as if they'd ever find out.  If you aren't careful with the disk editor, you could also mung something important... duh.  I guess that's a disclaimer.  Have at it....  Rob

maybe I can get a new disk 1...	    On a similar note, has anyone found out a way to do this with MS FoxPro for Windows? My setup.ini file was modified on disk 1 (all encrypted).. Well, of course I forgot about Microsoft's stupid arrangement when I got the  software, and used my name (it was paid for by the company I'm doing  consulting for.

0	Setting LASTDRIVE=Z means there are no "unassigned" (as opposed to
"unused") drive letters for NetWare to use, as it tacks its drive
mappings -onto the end- of the existing list of drives.	First off, I haven't used W4WG (but I think that's about to change!).  The problem is the LASTDRIVE command and the way NetWare in general (and in this case NETX in particular) adds drives to the device chain.  Setting LASTDRIVE=Z means there are no "unassigned" (as opposed to "unused") drive letters for NetWare to use, as it tacks its drive mappings -onto the end- of the existing list of drives.  W4WG obviously attaches its network drives to "existing, unused" drive letters.  I'd guess the next thing I'd try is something like LASTDRIVE=M, which on most machines will leave a fair swathe of drives for W4WG and still allow up to 13 NetWare drive mappings as well.

1	And four or five ecstatic ones.	Like who, f'rinstance?  When I bought my system (November), no first, second, or third tier vendor could touch the price for the hardware/software combination I got from GW2000.   If you were selling as many systems as fast as GW2000, you'd end up with four or five pissed-off customers too.  And four or five ecstatic ones.  And lots of satisfied ones...   Don't minimize this; if you buy mail order, it's a good thing to know that you'll get replacements parts, no questions asked, in a day or two, via FedEx.   Which they do in the vast majority of cases.  Remember that it's only the people on the tails of the curve who are motivated to write -- the ones who love it, and the ones who hate it.  You don't hear from the folks in the middle very often...

  Will Mathcad 4.0 run without a swap file, or insist that I use a swap file?	*** THIS IS LONG ***  I have 16MB of memory on my 386SX (25 MHz), an Intel math coprocessor, and a 120MB hard drive with 20MB free (no compression).

0	They are about par for fancy cards ..
   other accelerated cards also have bugs.	I had posted some questions regarding the new ATI Ultra Pro cards and had asked confirmation of some opinions.  This message is a summary of the responses. Thanks to all of you that replied.    a) The higher memory limits apply to ISA cards only, as far as I know.  The VLB    and EISA version should have no problems.   b) I'm pretty sure from my experience that the ISA version doesn't    work in systems with over 16M Ram.  There is supposed to be way    of switching the "memory aperture" feature off to prevent this,    but apparently it doesn't work.  I posted some "help me" messages    on the net and people indicated that the EISA card didn't have this    problem.  c) FALSE  d) The VLB card, which I have, allows you to set memory aperture over 32M    by using their configuration software.  No messing with jumpers necessary.     The 32M problem is probably valid only for ISA cards.    a) Again, the memory aperture need only be disabled if you have more than 124M RAM    (EISA and VLB) or 12 M (ISA).  32M should not be a problem for you.    b) Dunno.  c) Depends on the bus. YES if ISA, NO if EISA or Localbus    a) Nope.  I can use 640x480 at 72hz, 24-bit and 800x600 at 70hz, 24-bit, all    non-interlaced.  b) Yes - According to PC Magazine, they've tested a local bus version    that does 1024x768 in 24-bit which may or may not be interlaced.  c) Not for the Pro. Sometimes for the Plus.     Some modes may run only interlaced on certain monitors. This has nothing to     do with 24 bits ... only with screen size. Note that for 24 bit color    and Windows you MUST have 2 megs, memory size calculations notwithstanding.    a) They aren't perfect, but are much improved.  I don't recall the last time which    I had to leave mach 32 mode (ATI GUP mode) and switch to 8514 or VGA mode due    to software incompatibility.  b) True.  Many people recommended going back to Build 55 or 54.  c) They appear to be excellent, but have a few bugs. For example, certain    graphs with dashed lines in Mathcad 3.1 do not print correctly, though they    do display OK on the screen. They are about par for fancy cards ..    other accelerated cards also have bugs.  d) Overall, I like the card, even if driver performance is somewhat less than    satisfactory.  I am running the 1024*768 16 Color mode as that is all my    NT driver for October NT version seems to allow.     I will say this that Color performance is not quite as nice as a Diamond    Stealth VRAM, but I have not been able to try out a lot of the options on    the old driver.    a) It's quite fast, but whether or not its the fastest is open to debate.   b) Yes - I'll admit it was very very fast in 16-bit mode, which is what    I wanted to use it for.  Too bad it crashed (in many different ways)    every 20 minutes or so...  c) Depends on many many things.    a) I like it.  b) Well - PC Magazine seems to think it is.  c) Yes, this appears to be true :-)  d) As to greatest thing since sliced bread, I doubt it.  Better cards are    coming out.  Who knows, maybe ATI will come out with something faster yet.    Several reviews I read rated one Pycon Winjet card as a superior performer     at a cheaper price except for availability of drivers, which Pycon was     developing at that time.  (PC Magazine, about two months or so back)     Overall, the card has a lot of potential, but you have to be able to use it.    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- That is the end of the questions. These were the most discussed items in this group so I thought they needed confirmation. For those of you not familiar with the card I have included a summary here (from an ATI ad since I don't have an Graphics Ultra yet.)  ATI Graphics Ultra Plus: - Accelerated 1024x768 at 65K colours - True colour(16.7M) at 800x600 - Multimedia Video Acceleration (for Indeo Video,RLE and Video 1 compressed)   Stretch full motion video windows to full size - Fast VGA - Includes 3 button mouse (ISA versions only) - Anti-aliased fonts (ed. avail in 16 colour mode only,I think) - Real-time pan and zoom across large virtual windows desktop - Around a 1/2 length card size - Priced from $400 U.S.  ATI Graphics Ultra Pro: - Everything in Graphics Ultra Plus - Faster performance with VRAMS - Accelerated 1280x1024 at 256 colours 74Hz non-interlaced - Available in ISA, EISA and Microchannel - Priced from $600 U.S.  ATI Technologies (416) 756-0718  I hope this summary can be of use to you.  Al  P.S.  I am not associated with ATI Technologies in any way other       than having used their previous ATI Ultra card for a few       years (which I generally liked).

0	Yes and T1 text fonts all have the `ISO Adobe' character set, which is
a superset of Windows ANSI and Macintosh standard roman enocding.		Again, not true. The characters in a TT or Type 1 font depend on the  	maker. If someone converts a Type 1 font to TT they'll only get the 	characters in the font of orgin. TT allows for much more flexibility 	in this area as well. You can have thousands of glyphs in a TT font 	file (Mac/PS/Windows/Unicode char set) and use the characters 	appropriate for the particular platform you are running the font on.  Well, yes, both Type 1 and TrueType fonts can contain lots of characters. And in both cases plain text fonts will be reencoded to Windows ANSI in Windows, and to Mac standard roman encoding on the Mac.  No difference there between T1 and TT!     And as for fonts with thousands of glyphs, right know these are a liabiliaty rather than a great new thing.  Reason is that a font with 3000 characters is very large, and if you can only access 224 of them you are paying a heavy price in downloading time and printer storage.  (And at the moment there is only one program of that uses `partial font downloading')  	For instance, all or our fontpack 2 TT fonts have the Mac/Windows 	char set in them. The metrics of the fonts are such that if the font 	is brought over to the mac the user will have access to the full mac 	char set. 	  Yes and T1 text fonts all have the `ISO Adobe' character set, which is a superset of Windows ANSI and Macintosh standard roman enocding.  The question is whether you can get at the glyphs.  In Windows, for example, you cannot get at the ligatures `fi' anfd `fl' (both T1 and TT)even though a font may very well have them.  ANd, while it is somewhat painful to reencode a Type 1 font and to create a new Windows metric file (PFM) for it, there are utilities out there to allow you do this.  How do I reencode a TrueType font?  How can I get at the `fi' and `fl' ligatures in Windows (or on the Mac)?  Are there utilities that make it possible to circumvent the hard-wired Windows ANSI encoding?      > Regards,                                            1001-A East Harmony Road    > Bob Niland                                          Suite 503    > Internet:  rjn@csn.org                              Fort Collins CO 80525    > CompuServe: 71044,2124                              (303) 223-5209

1	Not good!	But I still cannot connect to my favorite DOS bbs with any kind of reliability.  I have success about 1/10 calls.  Not good!  I would hope that the fact that this one can connect to at least ONE of my fave places means I just need to adjust it.  What I usually get is a fast stream of garbage, in the modem response line on the dial window. Sometimes it will drop to full screen mode first, then I get about 2-3 screens of garbage.  In both cases the modem seems to time out before connecting and drops carrier.  I am using DEFAULT settings (AT&F) and getting this problem.  I am using the AUTOCONFIGURE settings that Gateway has supplied with my copy of Qmodem (ATW1&C1&D2S95=44&W0) and getting this problem. (They have refused to help me beyond this, claiming "it must be the BBS" or something like that.  Not so -- my work modem connects to this same place just fine, using factory settings -- a Microcom.)  Anyone have any ideas?!

	     I purchased a video card called ET-4000 true color card which      can provide about 1700K colors. But the question is I can't find      the corresponding drivers for windows 3.1 , I am now using 65k      colors driver for win31. It works fine , but I think it will be      better if I use 1700k driver. So, please tell me whether such a      driver is available !       Thanks in advance.

0	Not neat, but does
the job...I'm looking for a better solution though.	Well, in the latest Windows magazine, there is an advertisement for a program that will help you uninstall windows apps from your harddisk (Uninstaller) but it can be used to update a network, but only for deleting, not adding or changing their *.ini files.  (Uninstaller, by MicroHelp Inc.  $79 1-800-922-3383)  I am also looking for an *.ini updater for my PC network, and so far without any luck.  So for the time being I have been pushing DOS and it's batch language to its limit...look into DOS 5.0's (I am assumming that DOS 6.0 has the same command, maybe even more..or less..improved) REPLACE command. I use this to update our users personal files with a master set in a batch file that is run everytime they invoke Windows.  This basically overwrites their color schemes, but does what I need it to do.  Not neat, but does the job...I'm looking for a better solution though.  Mike  Just relaying what I know...a not for profit service.  
1	They should either be able to share IRQs or be able to use IRQs 8-15.	They should either be able to share IRQs or be able to use IRQs 8-15.
1	As far as I know, no other IRQ can be
used until your I/O-card is 16bit and caould access IRQ's > 8.	 Yes, you can change the IRQ's for com3/4, but it depends on your other hardware. com1 uses IRQ4, com2 IRQ3.  If you have only one printerport  ( IRQ7 ), you can change com3 to IRQ5 ( normally 2nd printer ). For com4, you can assign IRQ2, if its free. As far as I know, no other IRQ can be used until your I/O-card is 16bit and caould access IRQ's > 8.  Michael

	controller (I6) and keyboard (I1).		"These LPT1, COM1, disk controller are call devices.  There are 	devices that requires exclusive interrupt ownership, eg. disk 	controller (I6) and keyboard (I1).  There are also devices that 	does not require exclusive ownership, ie. it will share an 	interrupt with another device, eg. LPT1"  No.  In a standard ISA bus, the one that almost all non-laptop PCs use, two separate interface cards cannot share an interrupt.  This is due to a screwup in the bus design.  For example, if your Soundblaster wants to drive interrupt number 7, then it must hold a certain bus wire to 0 or 1 at all times, depending on whether or not it wants an interrupt. This precludes letting another card assert interrupt number 7.  When two or more devices in an ISA bus PC share an interrupt, it's because they're implemented by a single card.

0	both of these are 16 color drivers, if you're lucky the manufacturer of
your video card might have a driver that is compatable and will support a
mouse.	For Logitech rodents use  the lmouse driver that comes with windows.... also you need to be using a video driver that supports use of the mouse, both the VGA and SUPERVGA that come with Windows 3.1 will support it.  both of these are 16 color drivers, if you're lucky the manufacturer of your video card might have a driver that is compatable and will support a mouse.

1	Even if you could make such a statement it would be meaningless unless
you understood that ESDI and IDE (I include SCSI and ATA) are
completely different (ESDI is device-level, like MFM/RLL).	  (How is 0-40 twice 1.25? Do you just pick whatever SCSI setup that makes the statment "correct"?) Even if you could make such a statement it would be meaningless unless you understood that ESDI and IDE (I include SCSI and ATA) are completely different (ESDI is device-level, like MFM/RLL).    Great, you can compare two numbers (ATA has several speed modes, by the way) but what the article said was misleading/wrong.   I would recommend people call the NCR board and download the ANSI specs if they are really interested in this stuff.    Something is missing there. :) Anyway, I agree. There's a lot of opportunity for marketing jingo like "SCSI-2 compliant" which tells you nothing about the performance, whether it has "WIDE" support, etc.

1	I have seen some being sold used for about  
$90 with 4 Mg with space for another 4Mg's.		I have a 486sx25 ISA machine with Pheonix BIOS.  Currently I have   8 megabytes of RAM installed via eight 1 MG SIMMS on the motherboard: ie.   both banks are full, and there is no space for more SIMMS.  I am thinking   of running OS2 on my machine and Possibly Linux with X windows, and I know   that more RAM would be helpful.  However with SIMMS, the only solution I   can see is to sell my 8 Megs for about $180, and by 4 4mg SIMMS for about   $400 used. Apart from the fact that I can't afford the price right now,   the entire process of selling RAM and buying it used probably means that   the machine might be down for a number of days which I would rather   avoid...  So my question is, do the AT RAM boards that plug into a free slot work   well with a 486 ISA machine. I have seen some being sold used for about   $90 with 4 Mg with space for another 4Mg's.  If these boards do work, how   do they do it?  Is a device driver needed, or will the BIOS pickup the   extra RAM as it does with the SIMMS on the mother board? I know that the   ISA expansions slots are 16-bits and 486 SIMM memory is 32 bits, so   probably all of this is just wishful thinking... However any help is truly   appreciated.  -Eric

1	For this
reason I would pass.	I believe that any VL/EISA/ISA motherboard that uses the HINT chipset is limited to 24-bit EISA DMA (where 'real' EISA DMA is 32-bit).  The HINT EISA DMA has the 16 mb ram addressing limitation of ISA.  For this reason I would pass.  I own one of these (HAWK VL/EISA/ISA) and am look- ing to replace it for exactly this reason.  Please double-check me on this.  In other words, call the motherboard manufacturer and ask them if the motherboard supports true 32-bit EISA DMA.  Other than this limitation, the motherboard works quite well (I am using mine with DOS 5, Windows 3.1, and UNIX S5R3.2).  Also with Adaptec 1742a EISA SCSI host adapter.

1	this will enable

and controllers support it !	you  need to massage few switches in your system.ini. in the virtual memory section, flip the 32bitaccess switch on and the  associated driver (wdctl or some such) switch on.  this will enable 32bit access, but be sure you can use it, as not all hard drives and controllers support it !     ...for seriously fast disk access:  1)  throw out WINDOZE 2)  install OS/2  i did this weekend - OS/2 is incredible.  finally a REAL OS for the humble PC  :)
1	The access time usually means the delay time from falling edge of raw
address strobe (RAS) to data bus driven.	I'm sorry if I'm misunderstanding your post, but DRAM *does not* have to be refreshed on *each access cycle*.  So cycle time does *not* have to be twice the access time *because of refresh phase*.  The access time usually means the delay time from falling edge of raw address strobe (RAS) to data bus driven.  DRAM access cycle timing chart can be roughly shown as following (some signals are intentionally omitted);  ADDR --<RA><CA>-------<RA><CA>--------- RA=Raw Address, CA=Column Address RAS  ~~~~\________/~~~~~\________/~~~~~		~=High, _=Low, -=Floating CAS  ~~~~~~~\_______/~~~~~~\_______/~~~		<..>=driven either H or L DATA ---------<VALID>--------<VALID>---          |-------+------|          |-+--|  |            |     +----------- cycle time            +---- access time (or RAS access time)  Yes, the cycle time is more than twice as the access time but *not* because of the refresh phase.  The refresh can be done either as a trailing phase of normal access cycle or as an individual cycle.  [other stuff deleted]  Ken Nakata

1	Furthermore, IBM is
	including direct multimedia support in OS/2 starting with version
	2.1 (in addition to using Win-OS/2 3.1).	 Introduction:  	This is the third (and final) Call For Votes (CFV) for the creation 	of four OS/2 newsgroups and the renaming of one: 	(a)  create comp.os.os2.programmer.porting     (unmoderated) 	(b)  renaming of comp.os.os2.programmer to 	     comp.os.os2.programmer.misc               (unmoderated) 	(c)  comp.os.os2.setup                         (unmoderated) 	(d)  comp.os.os2.multimedia                    (unmoderated) 	(e)  comp.os.os2.bugs                          (unmoderated)  	This is the second attempt at creating comp.os.os2.programmer.porting 	and comp.os.os2.setup, and renaming comp.os.os2.programmer to 	comp.os.os2.programmer.misc.  The first attempt failed in the summer 	of 1992 (the voting deadline was August 31, 1992).  The voting rules 	state that another attempt for creating newsgroups can be started 	after a six month waiting period (in this case, it is March 1, 1993). 	This is the first attempt at creating comp.os.os2.multimedia and 	comp.os.os2.bugs.  	This document contains: 	*  the background showing the need for these proposals 	*  the proposed charters for these proposals 	*  voting instructions 	*  a voting ballot 	*  some example ballots 	*  the voting rules 	*  the voting schedule 	*  the Mass Acknowledgement   Background:  	The creation of two, free, 32-bit compilers for OS/2 2.x (gcc/2 	and emx/gcc; read comp.os.os2.programmer for details) has spurred 	a continuing deluge of software ported from UNIX platforms, such 	as emacs, less, awk, grep, sed, xscheme, ispell, flex, yacc, and 	much more.  Borland has released its C/C++ compiler for OS/2 2.x, 	allowing for easier porting of DOS and Windows software.  	Much of the PC hardware and drivers were written for DOS, and 	later, Windows.  As more people are discovering OS/2 2.x, the 	number of people asking questions about OS/2's compatibility 	with their hardware increases, as does the questions on the 	availability of drivers for their hardware, installation 	procedures, etc.  	Multimedia is becoming popular.  OS/2 2.0 supports Windows 	Multimedia Extensions using Win-OS/2 3.0.  Furthermore, IBM is 	including direct multimedia support in OS/2 starting with version 	2.1 (in addition to using Win-OS/2 3.1).  	Any non-trivial software will have bugs -- OS/2 is not exempt, 	especially since IBM is constantly adding new features to OS/2. 	So far, IBM has issued system patches and corrective service disks 	(e.g.  the Service Pak) for free (free from BBSs and ftp sites, or 	for free plus a small media charge for diskettes -- read 	comp.os.os2.misc for details).   Proposed Charters:  	(a)  create comp.os.os2.programmer.porting (unmoderated)  		It will provide a forum for developers of ported software so 		as to coordinate efforts, avoid duplication of effort, and 		spur additional development.  The group will also cover 		topics such as porting from other platforms (such as DOS, 		Windows, UNIX, etc), toolkits which aid in program 		portability (including porting tools such as Mirrors), and 		so forth.  	(b)  rename: comp.os.os2.programmer.misc (unmoderated)  		To keep the structure of the OS/2 newsgroup heirarchy 		orthogonal, comp.os.os2.programmer should be renamed to 		comp.os.os2.programmer.misc.  		comp.os.os2.programmer.misc will still be the newsgroup 		for OS/2 programmers to discuss programming issues and 		technical aspects of OS/2 in an unmoderated setting.  	(c)  create comp.os.os2.setup (unmoderated)  		It will be devoted to OS/2 system setup topics, including the 		availability of device drivers, compatibility information, 		installation procedures, system requirements, and overall 		performance optimization.  	(d)  create comp.os.os2.multimedia (unmoderated)  		It will provide a forum for discussion of multi-media issues.  	(e)  create comp.os.os2.bugs (unmoderated)  		It will provide a forum for OS/2 system bug reports, bug 		diagnosis and work arounds, the availability of system 		patches and corrective service disks, and so forth.  		[Note that discussion of bugs in applications belong in other 		newsgroups, and discussion of bugs in OS/2 betas belong in 		comp.os.os2.beta]   How to Vote:  	To cast your vote, fill out the ballot below and e-mail it to me.

Voting Rules:  	* One vote per person.  If you vote more than once, only the most 	  recent vote will be counted.  	* Votes must be mailed to me by the person voting.  Proxy voting, 	  forwarding, posting votes to a newsgroup, etc. will not be counted.  	* Do not ask how the votes are going.  The status of the votings 	  will be revealed only after the poll closes.  	* I will acknowledge votes by Mass Acknowledgement (ACK).  I will 	  post the ACK twice (see Schedule below).  	* If you need help for using your editor, using e-mail, how 	  voting works in general, etc. then ask an expert at your site. 	  Also see the ``How To Create a New Newsgroup'' article which is 	  posted to news.answers on a regular basis.  	* If you need any clarifications on voting procedures for this 	  CFV, send me e-mail at mlevis@ringer.cs.utsa.edu.  	* When the voting period is over (see Schedule below), a proposal 	  passes if both of the following formulas are true: 	  1)  the number of YES votes exceeds the number of NO votes 	      by at least 100 (i.e. YES >= NO + 100, or YES - NO >= 100). 	  2)  the number of YES votes exceeds at least twice the 	      number of NO votes (i.e. YES >= 2 * NO, or YES - NO >= NO). 	  In other words, a proposal passes if: 	      YES - NO >= max (100, NO) 	  where max() returns the highest number given to it.   Schedule:  	The voting period started on March 29 when the first CFV was posted 	by David Lawrence (the news.announce.newgroups moderator).  	This third CFV is a repeat of the first CFV, but it also has the 	Mass Acknowledgement (ACK) of names and e-mail addresses of those who 	have already voted -- re-send your vote if it is not there.  If you 	have not voted yet, vote now!  	The voting period will end at 11:59:59 pm (Central Time), on 	April 24, 1993.  Votes received after that time will not count. 	The voting results and tally will be posted shortly after that 	date.

1	This only happens
when the system has been off for a long time (eg overnight).	Previously, when I first start up my PC I can see all the  CMOS messages (RAM test ...etc) but now I've got to wait  for about 3min before the display shows anything and it starts up with a bright white flash.  This only happens when the system has been off for a long time (eg overnight). If it was only off for a couple of hours and then turned on again, the display works as normal like before.  Does anyone know what is causing this?  Is it a warning that it will give up soon or just signs of aging (the system is a 386sx and its about 3 yrs old).  I've used systems at work for years and never seen this happen to a monitor yet.  I'd really appreciated any help that you fellow netters can offer. Thanks a lot.  Edwin -- 
1	I can back up over the network and such, but if I need to reboot,
I have to turn off the computer and repeat the steps above.	Is it possible to short out your CMOS chip?  I think mine is fried. These are the symptoms...  I have to do the following to get my computer (a Gateway 486DX33) to boot...      Turn the power off      Disconnect the battery to the CMOS chip      Turn the power on      Get into setup upon getting the CMOS configuration error      Set up the CMOS      Exit the setup with [F10]  (phoenix bios)      Ignore the diskette 0 seek error and press [F1]  The computer then boots normally.  Both hard drives are accessible but the floppy drives are not.  I can back up over the network and such, but if I need to reboot, I have to turn off the computer and repeat the steps above.  If I simply <Ctl>-<Alt>-<Del>, the computer hangs after the memory test.  Does this sound like the CMOS chip is fried?  Can I buy another one? Where?  Thank you for your kind attention.  john

0	As a standard disclaimer I would like to point out the following facts:
1) Some of these files may run your adapter out of spec.	THESE FILES ARE UNSUPPORTED!  IBM has nothing to do with these files or this post.  It's personal this time (and every time I post -- see the signature).  Due to demand and requests, here are some additional DMQS files I've collected for the XGA-2.  These files function with the latest revision of the drivers for the XGA-2.  Not all these files will work under Windows with the drivers available to the general public at this time.  All files will function under the most recent OS/2 2.1 beta and those I've tried have worked under OS/2 2.0+SP.  Not all files have been fully tested.  THESE FILES ARE UNSUPPORTED!  They represent a personal collection, not anything resembling an officially supported set.  As a standard disclaimer I would like to point out the following facts: 1) Some of these files may run your adapter out of spec.  Doing so can    stress the ICs on the card and may result in incorrect operation or in    shorter life (how short depends on how much out of spec [boom!] :-). 2) Some of these files may run your adapter in a region that is out of    spec for your monitor, resulting in damage to your monitor. 3) You should be knowledgable about your monitor and adapter's ability    to use the mode you select.  Using these files represents hacking    in a very true sense, so practice safe computing and don't play    around too much if you don't like the risks and aren't knowledgable    about what you're doing. 4) If you feel uncomfortable with all the warnings, use the DMQS files    you have or wait until IBM releases official, tested DMQS files.    Although you should be aware of warning 2) even with the IBM files.  THESE FILES ARE UNSUPPORTED!  By using them you may invalidate your warrenty.  Not all have been fully tested -- I don't have that many monitors.  Installation: unpack in your DMQSPATH environment variable, usually c:\xga$dmqs.  Then use the methods described in your XGA-2 installation diskette to change your adapter or settings.  Packing: these files have been packed with the latest INFOZIP utility.   You will need PKZip 2.x if you don't have the INFOZIP utilities.  Submitting:  feel free to send me uuencoded versions of your favorite DMQS files for your favorite monitors.  I'm always interested in collecting more.  Archive:  these files have been uploaded to ftp-os2.nmsu.edu in pub/uploads/xga2dmqs.zip.

/* An example of how to read PC joystick port by polling the hardware port

I read it directly from the hardware port. Note that doing so exposes you to intermittent disturbance from interrupts, so you may want to read (say) twice in a row and keep the lower results.

product, with several features beyond the DOS version.	While I do not speak for Peter Tattam, I am fairly sure he is planning a  Winsock compliant version.  While this will definitely not make the initial public release of WinTrumpet, it will follow on shortly thereafter.  Currently WinTrumpet is in very late beta.  It looks like an excellent  product, with several features beyond the DOS version.  WinTrumpet supports the Trumpet TCP, Novell LWP, and there is also a direct to  packet driver version that some people are using with the dis_pkt shim.  Ashok

sysinfo disk reading because the contoller intercepts the calls, at 
least that was what the program said.
	I found the new drivers to be a significant improvement over the 1.2 version,  improving my graphic winmarks (v3.11) by about 2 million (7.77 to 9.88)  although this could be the result of intentional benchmark cheating on  Cirrus's part but I don't think so.  From Steve Gibson's (columnist for Info World) graphic card comparisons  (also found at the cica ftp site under the name winadv.zip) I extracted the  following for the sake of comparison:  							Wintach              		Winbn3.11	Word	Sprsht	Cad	Paint	Overall Steve's system: 486/33 VLB: ATI Graphics Ultra Pro	  9.33		10.34	 20.78	8.28	14.90	 13.58  my system - 486sx/33 VLB: VL24 Bitblaster		  9.88		 8.65	 11.71	18.84	15.40	 13.65   Its no Viper, but I think its a hell of a deal at about a third of the cost of  the ATI card and when compared to the other cards included in Gibson's review.  Micron system owner's, I would be interested to hear your opinions on the  DTC 2270VL local bus disk controller. My system came with a Maxtor 7120  drive (120 MB) and at first was only giving me disk winmarks of about 16 Kb/s,  I am now at 22 Kb/s. Is this about as good as it gets?

0	(I only recently "upgraded" from Quick C 2.0 to 2.5.)	I am concerned that Quick C in a DOS window has somehow strayed outside its protected mode world and corrupted the smartdrv.exe disk cache and that is what caused the disk problem.  I thought that DOS programs run in DOS windows were pretty well-contained  by Windows.  If that is true, then maybe the Quick C compiler has nothing  to do with it.  Has anybody else had this type of problem?  (I only recently "upgraded" from Quick C 2.0 to 2.5.)  Brad Banko

0	Put the ball back in, put the cover on, and there you are.	Try this:  flip your mouse over, and open up the cover that holds the mouse ball in place.  Remove the ball, and inside you should see (probably) 3 rollers.  If any of the rollers have a tiny layer of caked-on dirt, dust, or otherwise unidentifiable scum on them, carefully scrape it off with a small knife (Xacto works great).  *Be Careful* You do not want to gauge the rollers, just clean off the dirt. Put the ball back in, put the cover on, and there you are.    I clean a couple of dozen of these every month here.  Another symptom is that when you move the mouse, it seems to "click" along.  If this doesn't solve your problem, at least you have a clean mouse.  I highly recommend using a proper _soft_ mouse pad, and if you are a clean freak, place it in your drawer every night or when you don't use it to keep the dust off.  Personally I prefer track balls.  Oh, which brings me to another point: if your mouse or trackball tracks optically, and the sunlight is  streaming through the window onto your mouse/trackball, you may notice that it will stop working.  If this happens to you, close the curtains or blinds, or simply shade your pointing device, and see if that helps.

------------------------------------------------------------------	Another (albeit strange) option is using a program like 800 II (available via anonymous FTP at many major sites), or FDFORMAT (also available via anonymous FTP), that allows you to format 5.25HD disks to 1.44Meg, or 3.5"HD disks to 1.2Meg (along with many MANY other formats!) so you can DISKCOPY (yes, the broken MeSsy-DOS DISKCOPY!) the 5.25" disks onto 3.5" disks or vice versa...  I use this techniques with "NON-DOS" self-booting  game disks on my old Tandy 1000, and it works...  Another program named Teledisk (shareware--available on many major BBS's) will also make the weird format disks, provided you have 800 II or FDFormat installed....  Some disks that won't DISKCOPY properly can be readily Teledisk'd into the proper format...

0	It seems to me much more easier to use than Microsoft,
  specially the debugger.	Time for a new discussion, maybe ? I asked in these groups some time ago what about the TC++/VE, and got no answers, so I decided to try. My brother who lives in the US bought and sent it to me, and I'm still trying to get used to it.  Before I put my good/bad points list, consider I am a Turbo Pascal/DOS programmer, and sometimes try to make something in Unix with C (just some exercises from university). I used to make some programs in Microsoft C version 5 (!!) because we used some third-party libraries that required that.  - I like Borland. It seems to me much more easier to use than Microsoft,   specially the debugger. I tried to learn Codeview sometimes, but never   felt confortable with it. - TC++ V/E seems very nice to create simple apps, like the examples on the   ObjectWindows book. So far, no problems. Lets see next week or so, when I   will try something more complex. - It works nice even in my "weak" machine 386/16Mhz, 6 Mb Ram.   But.....  - The manual for the Resource Workshop seems to be from a different version    from the Workshop itself. Some of the windows that appear on the manual   have more itens than in the manual. - I think I will run into trouble since I got this TC++/VE from my brother   as a present. I didnt wanted to buy the Japanese version because 1) I    suspect that the manuals will be in Japanese :-( and 2) I believe it   will be far more expensive here. So he bought it as a present and sent to   me, I send the registration card to the Japanese branch of Borland, but...   who knows.  So, I'd like to ask some questions for you all;  - I know that there are some Microsoft guys around here in this group. Is   there anybody from Borland ? Is there any e-mail address that we can    contact the technical support ? Not for stupid questions, but to ask   for example, why the RW manual seems to be different from the RW itself ? - Is there anybody else using it around here ? - Will the book of Petzold be useful for me ? I intend to use RW and ProtoGen   to make the interfaces and then work on the code itself.   Answers to my e-mail or comp.os.ms-windows.programmer.tools, please.  Thanks in advance,
1	Now the hard part - where can I get one in Australia,
preferably Brisbane?	My current I/O card uses 8250's (correct number? The braindead ones anyway). It also controls two floppy drives, and two IDE hard drives.  Ideally, I'd like to get a new multi I/O card, that had 2 serial ports with 16550's and could also control another 2 IDE HD's. It would have to have configurable addresses for both the serial ports, and the IDE controller, so it could co-exist with my existing card.  Does such a beast exist?

Fahrenheit 1280+, 1MB, bios 1.1

The basic problem is that vertical lines are missing from the display in windows. Something like every other line or so. Also, when I use a DOS gif viewer, namely vpic 6.0c, in Fahrenheit 1280 mode, vertical lines are swapped. It's very strange looking. If it uses VESA standards, however, it works great! only it thinks there's only 512K on the card. (There's 1MB on there).    I have contacted Orchid support, and they tried to be helpful, but didn't have the answer. I don't think the card is the problem, since it works great on my friend's computer.

The modem receive light was on pretty solidly, so it looks like the bottleneck was the 9600-baud modem, not the screen drawing.

Alex.

	Just a thought on resources,  It is very important if you do use a multiplatform toolkit to check on how it uses resources.  I have used Glockenspeil commonview under Motif and OS2.  I wrote a resource converter from OS2 to Motif, but it really wasn't too easy, especially the naming scheme. In Motif you cannot rename controls/widgets. With windows you can call the OK button ID_OK in every instance, this doesn't work for Motif, you'd have to call it Dialog1_OK, and Motif expects a text string rather than a number.  So  your constructor should know how to convert a #define into the proper resource identifier. I'd check on how the toolkit expects names, and that if it does use resources, that is uses resources for all platforms you intend to port to. ( By the way, I would never use CommonView or Glockenspiel for anything )     Alex.

1	while you were doing something else.	IDE also uses DMA techniques.  I believe floppy controller also uses DMA, and most A/D boards also use DMA.  DMA is no big deal, and has nothing to do directly with SCSI.   You can thank your software for that.  If DOS had a few more brains, it could format floppies etc. while you were doing something else.  The hardware will support it, but DOS (at least) won't.  Again, this has    nothing to do with SCSI.   And if you stick with DOS you'll wonder why you can't multitask.

Dexxa:  This scanner is available at Wal-Mart for $90.  It includes GrayWorks software and provides 400 dpi and 32 grayscales (I think).  The OCR software Catchword is available through mail-order for about $90 also.  Mustek:  (Gray Artist for Windows)  This scanner offers 256 grayscales (according to Cad & Graphics) and 800 dpi.  It is available for $169 mail-order and comes with Perceive OCR and Picture Publisher LE.  I am also looking at a Genius hand scanner (B105) from Cad & Graphics.  It is basically the same as the Mustek scanner except for the resolution (400 dpi) and price ($149).    Basically, I would like recommendations on which to buy.  I have heard that Logitech makes the best and manufactures Dexxa scanners.  But which one is the best buy?  Would 800 dpi really be helpful (output would be no better than HP LaserJet III or Canon BJ-200 - 300x300 to 360x360)?  I am leaning toward the Mustek because it offers the most features and is in the middle in terms of prices.  Which should I buy?  If you have a hand scanner, please let me know whether or not you would recommend it.  Also, if you know of another scanner within the price range (under $225) that would be a better deal, please E-Mail me.  Any and all help would be greatly appreciated.

1	The 'T' connectors are simply tracks with slots on them - no electronics
on it.	I'm not sure if this will work, but how about using one of those 'T' expanders used in the low-profile cases.  They allow 3-5 slots staggered on either side of the card.  You can install it in the last slot, and then (probably)  have 2 or 3 sideways slots.  This is actually how it is done in the low profile cases - a standard motherboard, the 'T' connector in one slot,  and the expansion cards plugged into the 'T'.  I guess you could do this at  each end of the slots (1 & 8) to add even more.    The 'T' connectors are simply tracks with slots on them - no electronics on it.  The only downside - your case won't close, but for a homebrew system, that may not be a problem.  Don't know about performance, though.  I'll leave that discussion to the  engineers.

Regards, Richard

Be sure you have the 5426 driver version 1.2   Don't quote me on this one, but I'd steer clear of the multi resolution driver that allows you to change resolution without exiting Windows.  I think it's buggy.   Version 1.3 drivers are due to be release by Cirrus soon. Unfortunately, their not available via FTP, you have to dial up their BBS in the USA.  I do this from NZ using a 14.4k modem to cut down on phone bills.  It took me around 7 minutes to  download the v1.2 driver.   Good Luck,

If you allocate some ram to EMM386 the problem  should go away.

0	But if users forget to delete some related files, the disk will be full
    of nonsense files.	  Days ago people doubted that ms-windows is not a real OS. I can see why they have such question. Ms-windows confuses many people. Microsoft simulated Mac, but it did a lousy job.  For example:  (1) You can not create hierarchy groups. There is no way to create a group     in a group. (If you know how, please tell me.) (2) Too many system parameters to take care of.  (3) uncomplete documentation. It's not easy to find the reason why causes     an unpredictable error. (4) Group deleting/file deleting     After deleting a group, users have to use file manager to delete files.     But if users forget to delete some related files, the disk will be full     of nonsense files. (5) share problem     Once you create two windows doing compilation and editing in some     language (w/o good editor), there will be a sharing problem. You just     can not open or save the program if it is loaded. It makes sense to     prevent from saving, but not opening.  Microsoft try to compromise between DOS and windows, but they just make  ms-windows a graphical DOS with capacity doing mutiple DOS jobs;  the worst thing is they complicate the environment. The orginal purpose of ms-windows should be to simplify the environment, and make PC easier  to use.      It's by no means easy to satisfy everybody, but if Microsoft want to keep their reputations, they should evaluate the user interface more carefully before products distribute.    No flame, please.
