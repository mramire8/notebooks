1	.	If you'll settle for someone who _went_ to an aviation university . . .. . I graduated from Purdue University in 1990 from the School of Aviation. Technology.  I went through the maintenance/flight option and graduated with my. A&P, CFI, ASMEL, 50 hours of King Air, 85 hours of Mitsubishi Diamond jet, and a. B.S. degree.  Purdue offers options in all of the areas you mention.  While it's. certainly not a perfect program, I think it is better than average.  To address. your individual questions:. . > 1. Are you able to fly enough (VFR) due to weather, and are you able to fly. > in IFR conditions also at that college?. . Wasn't too much of a problem.  There are certainly times when VFR courses get a. little tight due to WX, but I'd take that trade off for never getting any actual. IFR time.. . > 2. Are you able to fly enough due to Aircraft Availability/Maintenance. . Was never an issue.  Equipment is always in excellent condition, top notch staff. of mechanics.  The program is extremely selective - only about 60 or so per year. in flight, and a few flight/________ to guarantee availability.  They  are not. interested in seeing how many people they can crank through, but insuring those. in the program have quality instruction.. . > 3. Are you able to get more than enough experience to qualify you to become a. > commercial pilot. . That is solely a function of the market at the time you graduate.  When I. graduated, things were very  tight and many peole couldn't find work.  Now you. could probably have a job waiting when you graduate, but that too will probably. change by the time you get out (probably more than once).  They key is to get as. much experience as you can whilst in school.  Instruct part-time, fly jumpers,. photography, traffic patrol, whatever, so that you have the market requirements. or as close to them as possible when you get out.. . > 4.  How is the scheduling system for flying at that college?. . Your flying is a regularly scheduled class slot - you don't have to fight for an. airplane most of the time.  There is some extra flying required on weekends -. cross country and such, but again with the limited enrollment, it's not too much. of an issue.  Most instructors will try and do a few extra sessions to get ahead. and preclude trouble finishing up due to WX or checkrides.. . > 5. Instructor Quality and availability. . Instructors are scheduled with you every flight period.  I felt that quality was. pretty good.  They have both full time staff, and part-time instructors (who are. upperclassmen with their CFI's).  You could always get a bad apple, but all of. mine were quite good.  I still use little thoughts my instrument instructor. shared with me ten years and over 3000 hours ago.. . > 6. Multi-engine time given. . 10 hours to get your MEL.  Additionally, most students get time in the schools. King Air C-90 & B-200.  The amount of time varies, I used to be a record holder. at around 55 hours.  I think 10-15 is more typical.  It's not just jump in the. right seat and run the radios, though.  You first have a two courses on the. flight departments proceedures and King Air systems and operations.  Only after. successfully completing those do you fly with the captians on trips hauling. university officials.  This really is excellent experience.  You may fly into. Chicago O'Hare, Washington National, Teterboro, or other major airports.. Operations are conducted like a professional flight department, because that's. what it is, not just flight instruction.  You certainly will recieve instruction. while doing this, but you are also treated as a fellow professional.. Additionally, you will fly the aircraft - not just run radios.. . > 7. Class B/C airspace experience. . See above, additionally you will get experience in C airspace while working on. all of your ratings.. . > 8. Speed at which the programs are completed. . Private throught Commercial/Instrument Freshman and Sophmore years (and. Associates degree).  B-727 Flight Engineer rating (not just the written) along. with transport catagory systems, proceedures, operations, and B-727 simulator. training (and I hear they are adding a Dornier simulator) during Junior and. Senior years.  Some work is required during the one or two summers.. Additionally, there is a program I participated in where 6 students a year are. sent to FlightSafety and trained and typed in the Beechjet 400A (Diamond when I. was there).  The students then fly as FO's for the next year.. . > And are you a freshman, sophomore, junior or senior.. . As I said, I graduated in 1990.  I spent the next several years doing a. combination of flight instruction, corporate fill-in, and working at the local. Target store (remember what I said about the market when you graduate).  In 1994. I got a job as a FO at a startup charter & management company.  I was the second. employee flying a Sabreliner 40.  Over the next four years we added a Westwind. (which was later sold), a King Air 200, and a Gulfstream II.  I flew as a. captain on both the Sabre & WWII.  Last July, I left to take a position as a FO. with American Trans Air (ATA).  I'm now flying as FO on an L-1011.. . I can honestly say that I didn't appreciate much of what I got out of Purdue. until the past couple of years.  When things are slow in aviation, it doesn't. much matter what school you've been to or what you've done.  What a good school. will do is give you the knowledge to succeed once you do get hired.. Additionally, a well respected school will get the attention of the person. reading the resume when things improve.. . One or two additional thoughts -. You didn't mention what your specific area of interest in aviation is- airline,. corporate, ect.  What options you choose could be guided by your area of. interest.  EG- I planned on flying corporate.  My A&P was extremely helpful in. getting my last job.  If you are interested in management, structure your. education towards that.. . Also, I strongly advocate attending a school which is known outside of. aviation.  If you can't find work in aviation due to the economy, losing a. medical, priorities in life chage (it happens) - you will probably find that a. degree from a well accredited school will open more doors than one from an. aviation only school.  Perhaps even better would be to get a degree in another. area entirely (aside from flying that is) and get the flight training on the. side or as a minor.  It really depends on what other areas interest you, but I. can't overemphasize having another skill to back up flying.  I know of several. people who have four year degrees in aviation who are working in fields other. than aviation.. . Sorry this has run so long, but I hope it helps.  My closing disclaimer on all. of the above is that I've been very lucky to be where I am now.  I've been at. the right place at the right time which is invaluable, but I'd also like to. belive that I've had the necessary skills and knowledge when opportunities. presented themselves.  Much of that knowledge I acquired while at Purdue.. Dealer prep charges, tax and title not included, your milage may vary, not. applicable where prohibited by law, always see a trained professional before. starting any weight loss program, look both ways before crossing.. . Feel free to E-mail me if I can mislead you further . . .   ;-). .

Just curious...I just don't seem to. >have the feel/sensitivity/modulation in my left foot for "at the limit". >braking!. . I brake with my left foot in sims, but not in my real car. Same. problem as yours: lack of the right kind of. feel/sensitivity/modulation. . . I think the difference has a lot to do with the wheel and pedals we're. using in sims. I'm not familiar with the more modern / expensive. units, but the pedals on my T2 are identical for gas and brake. They. both have the same travel and resistance - which gas and brake on my. real car definitely don't have. :) . . The T2 brake pedal feels and operates more like a real life clutch. pedal, which is why (I guess) my left foot has no problems operating. it - it's used to gently depressing a pedal like this. It is not used. to modulating pressure with little travel, though, as needed for a. real brake pedal. . . Likewise, I don't drive my real car with the left hand in 12 o'clock. position and the right hand hovering over the shifter, as I do in GPL.. The real car has extensive "force feedback effects" which make. steering with both hands necessary. Sims, esp. GPL, require delicate,. fast steering and fast shifting, but my wheel doesn't have a lot of. travel or force feedback. . . -- .

0	I never went from sims to real but i went
the other way.	I think it can prepare you somewhat.  I never went from sims to real but i went. the other way.  I drove a mini-sprint of my friends several times (when he was. sick or unable to race) and was pretty good at it.  I was able to make the main. a few times and once managed a top five finish.  This experiance i think helps. me in GPL especially because trying to controll a powerful car on dirt is alot. harder than pavement.  Now im not the best at GPL, ill admit that, but i was. able to go fast sooner than if i had no experiance at all.  . . Now the way i see it, if real world racing helped me in the virtual world, then. it should work the other way.  Being a good sim racer will never fully prepare. you for driving a real car...but it will definately help.. . The part i find that alot of people dont understand in sims is setups.

Avault does indeed have a responsibility to. present its views (and reviews) in a responsible manner, since. they're looked upon as "the experts" in gaming (so to speak).. . It would be unprofessional of me to make any comments, negative or. positive, concerning Avault's column, however, I can take a stand. on their review policy.  Avault should only allow those who are. qualified for a specific genre to review same.  In other words,. they shouldn't allow one who's main gig is Rainbow-6 to review. Viper or NFS-III, nor should they allow sim racers to review the. latest Quake level.. . Of course, there are always exceptions, as some who run the tracks. also run the halls of the shoot-em-ups.  The point is that the. review should be kept to those who know know what's up in their. particular field of interest, and if they don't know, then to keep. their respective views to themselves.. . .

much better.	Hi Bill,. I had the devil of a time with landings for a. while and I thought I'd never master it.  I. had been focusing on the runway in front. of me and never getting a sight picture of. the flare angle out of the side window.  It. really started to help, when I finally broke. away from staring out in front and began. looking out the side once in a while.  Your. primary focus has to be in front of you to. stay on the center line.  Also, I first started. flying in Cessnas which are high wing then. I switched to Katanas which are low wing and. found much better success.  I plan to buy a. low wing airplane ONLY.  I like the visibility. much better.. The last thing that helped was my instructor. started having me only do short and soft field. takeoffs and landings.  They kept me so busy. for a while, that the regular ones were a piece. of cake!. I hope this helps.  Hang in there, it does get. better.. Mary Ann. .

Your right about this and Papyrus knows this.You need to realize that papyrus. is filling a void with thier extreme realism sims.If it wasnt for them them. what would us hardcore racing sim drivers do???It's the same with fighter. combat sims too in that its a very small percentage of gamers that will. actually sit down for hrs and learn to fly an F15.I think that most of the. Papyrus crew is financially well off enough to keep themselves happy and. doing what they love to do...build realistic racing sims.If not then these. people would move on to more profitable game genres.

other problem is that we are missing the seat of the pants feel for the car.	I saw James Gardner on Speedvision and he was narrating a sport car racing. serial in the 1969-70 era and they had a crude in-car camera.  They. basically were crashing every lap if you know what I mean.  To drive. anything fast in that period seemed to be on the very, very ragged edge.  I. have so many hours in GPL at each track that I have learn to just float the. car.  I worked the setup to get what I want and my lap replays are faster. than the Pappy boys and way smoother.  No doubt, I am busy with the steering. wheel, but I drive the car like I would in real life.  The Speedvision show. I saw confirmed that GPL and real life are fairly close in some respects but. in order to be total "real life" the sim needs to "slow down" a tad.  The. other problem is that we are missing the seat of the pants feel for the car.. In computer life, we react visually, and that is what give us the ragged. edge driving sensation in GPL.  In others words, by driving visually, we are. tad behind the eight ball.  In real life, our butts are the best processor. God gave us for as countering g forces in the seating position. Keep at it. and work those setups. A good driving wheel helps too.  I have an ECCI CDS2R. system modified to be similar to the CDS 4000.  I don't know how anyone can. drive GPL with a Thrustmaster product.  Your seating ergonomics is very. important too.  My seat height/pedal location and steering position are. exactly like Dale Earnhardt's  cars.  I used one of his to get the. measurements.  The bottom line to your post is that GPL is hard.

Certainly the modern monocoque would have greater torsional rigidity than. the 67 cars, and the use of the engine as a stressed member is way more. advanced (I think in 67 this had begun?).  Weight should be down due to. finite element analysis and the resultant limit state design using the. appropriate materials - materials research is one of the key areas of. advancement IMO.. . The question could also be split - a modern F1 with wings removed and crap. tyres versus a purpose designed no-downforce-crappy-tyre beast.  The latter. would likely be a bunch lighter due to the reduced forces acting on it as. well as having a suspension optimised using modern techniques to take full. advantage (empty disadvantage?) of the crappy tyres and no downforce.. .

1	All three taught me techniques or preferences which the others had not.	Today, I flew solo.  I was ready last month, but lost my instructor (he. moved) before weather conditions would cooperate.  Tried a different. instructor at the same school, but wasn't comfortable with him.  And this. leads to why I am writing this post . . . .. . Don't be afraid to change CFI's or flight schools if you feel uncomfortable.. I live in Dallas and was originally flying at Addison Airport, which is an. extremely busy single runway airport.  On weekends, 20 minute waiting times. to take-off are the norm, as well as looong extended downwinds.  And the. nearest touch & go airport (Frisco, uncontrolled) often has 4-5 airplanes in. the pattern.  Anyway, I quickly discovered that I was losing about 40% of my. Hobbs time doing things that were not productive.  Although training at a. busy airport can be good experience, I quickly felt the added cost was. difficult to justify.  Also, during my training there, I witnessed 2. potential mid-air collisions (both involved airplanes crossing final. approach @ 500 AGL while other planes were landing) and a crash at Frisco (I. was # 2 to land when it happened . . . and that's an e-mail for another. day).. . So after my instructor told me he was leaving, I drove out to several nearby. airports & visited their flight schools.  I finally picked Red Bird Airport.. I liked that fact that it was relatively uncrowded, allowed touch & go's,. and has 2 runways (35-17, 31-31) which is a plus for crosswind conditions.. In a nutshell, I felt safer there.. . My transition w/ my new instructor was quick, just 2.4 hours dual before he. gave me the okay.  He even went up to the control tower to monitor my flight. & to let the controllers know it was my 1st solo.  Although I had been. nervous before the flight -- I even missed my exit while driving to the. airport -- I was calm once I did a couple of touch & go's w/ the instructor.. My solo was relatively uneventful & I was pleased w/ my 3 landings.. . One last point, having another CFI's viewpoint on training is beneficial.. All three taught me techniques or preferences which the others had not.. . Ecstatically Yours,. Ken. 18.7 TT, 0.4 Solo!. . P.S.  Please don't take this as a knock on Addison Airport, it is a fine. airport and the flight schools there are very good.  It just wasn't a fit. for me.. . .

Now, after starting FS98,. it gets thin black and white lines across the screen and freezes if I try to. fly for long.  The scenery is multi-colored.. pinks and greens and the black. and white lines are mostly on the panel.  I have a VIA motherboard which. apparently doesn't recognize the Viper 550 or something like that.  Also, there. are driver problems apparently.  From my discussions with two different people. at the store I got it at, the VIA is a bad board.  Anybody have any experience. with it?  Are there any recommended drivers or any other advice?  I went to the. diamond site and downloaded the fix with the latest date and also got something. at the VIA site.  Are there any experts who can help?

This is a game that is designed to run. on a wide variety of systems -- including consoles -- and complex. physics that require floating-point calculations would introduce. performance penalties that a game like this probably couldn't sustain.. In our house, NFS3 was purchased as a toy we could play on our. networked systems, and the fact that it runs in all its glory (minus. dashboards) on a P200MMX/Voodoo1was a decisive factor in our decision. to buy it.  . . Arcade racing games are a well-defined market, also, and EA's success. comes from giving markets what they want.  . . And yet, NFS3's cars seem, to me, to handle somewhat more believably. than those in many other arcade racers.  I'm not sure I'd want more. depth in the modeling than this game offers.  (I did buy GPL the same. day, so maybe I'm more willing to let NFS3 be what it is.). . [snip]. . RichC. *-------------To Reply via E-Mail-------------*.

	I had to clock my voodoo down to 80Mhz. Even 82mhz still gave problems.My theory is as you step up the processor. (celron@504) the fill rate of the  v2 finally gets used.This causes heat. that isn't. evident with lower speed processors. My old P5MMX @291 never had the problem with. the same V2. If it was the overclocking of the processor i don't think underclocking the. V2 would fix it. I don't know if anyone else has dropped as low as 80Mhz. but it's. cure to my lockups and still a full  36fps most. every where.. Hope this helps. Ken. . . "J.

I recently bought an Intel Celeron 300a retail version (includes 3-year. warranty and heatsink/fan), Abit BH6 motherboard, and 64 MB of PC100 memory from. Azzo Computers for $415 + $14 shipping.  Got it installed, revved it up to 450. MHz, and it ran at 450 first time, no tweaking or extra cooling needed.  The. general word seems to be that a Celeron 300a has about a 75-80% chance of. running successfully at 450, although some voltage tweaking may be necessary to. do it (and if you boost the voltage, you might want to invest in a bigger CPU. cooler).  That's why people like the BH6 so much--all the CMOS settings are. accessible via software, and it's a snap to change virtually everything.. .    It might be possible to get a Celeron 333a to 500 MHz, or certain batches of. Pentium II-333s to 500 MHz, but they're rare and difficult to do.  A C300a. running at 450 is more likely.  Even with an old Orchid Righteous 3D (Voodoo 1). card, I get no lower than 15 fps at the start of a 19-car GPL race, and if. there's nothing near me on the track, I always get 36 fps.  The only things that. kill the frame rate are smoke and dust.. .    So yeah...for a game setup, an overclocked Celeron 300a is hard to beat.. . . Check six,.

1	As the chart shows that
the total drag curve is U shaped.	Power is used to counteract drag.  As the chart shows that. the total drag curve is U shaped.  The slow side of the "U". is called the area of reverse command or as some people put. it, the back side of the power curve.. . What is "reversed" here is that it takes MORE power to maintain. level flight at a SLOWER airspeed.  On the normal side, MORE. POWER (as Tim Allen would say) means more speed.. . The reason this is important is that you only have a finite. amount of power available.  As you get higher up on that. slow side of the power curve, you may find that you no longer. have enough power to maintain flight at that speed.  The. recovery is a bit counter intuitive.  You have to lower the. nose and speed up.. . > In the middle is the optimum power setting.. . Depends on how you define optimum.  Yes it's the minimal. drag setting, but most of us would rather fly a lot faster. since we got extra power available to us.. . The term "reverse control" or "control reversal" is more. frequently used to refer to aerodyamic effects in the. transonic range where the controls work in reverse..

	Ahh.. that's why you couldn't get my setups to work.... http://webhome.idirect.com/~drbryan/gpl/files/setups/ferrari.htm. . Not sure what browser you're using or what you were trying to do with the. files... but here's the instructions (thought it was common knowledge)... Good idea though, for the "notebook".. might implement it... yes.. I think I. will!. . Download the files (mine are separate:. - setup files are only 1K (no need to zip), and are in the filename.fe1. format..     "Fe1" is the default extension for GPL's GP1-class FERRARI lap times..     Likewise, Lotus GP3 setup file would be "Lo3". - replays are ZIPPED, and when unzipped are "filename.rpy" - the default. replay file extension for GPL.. . Let's say you were downloading my Ferrari (GP1-class) Kyalami lap time. (1:22.95). - You first download the files onto your harddrive. (I made a "downloads". directory in my GPL folder.). - You copy the "dok_fer_kya12295.fe1" (in this case) file into your. "../sierra/gpl/players/YOUR_NAME_setups/kyalami/" directory. - You copy the (now unzipped) "dok_fer_kya12295.rpy" file into the. "../sierra/gpl/replay/" directory. . That's it!! Now you load up GPL.. and if you have the Ferrari car selected,. this setup will be accessible from the "Kyalami" folder on the setup screen.. Want to write down the settings? Go ahead! (I'll be doing this shortly so. you won't have to). . Hope that helps!. . doktorB. http://webhome.idirect.com/~drbryan/gpl. -- Exclusive offer: PDPI L4 Digital Gamecard.

Thanks alot,.

The box is a little smaller. than the box my T2 came in.  I think it's just well packed.. The size of the unit appears to be similar to that of the. NASCAR Pro.  Indeed, it seems the whole project was done as. a modification of the NASCAR Pro.. . The pedals are as found in the NASCAR Pro.

One presumes. the setup software will allow for remapping of the pedals to. both joined and separate axes.. . The unit has a shifter, again right out of the NASCAR Pro.. That stick shift was very well made, with a nice throw to. it -- much better than the stiff one on the T2.  The unit. also appears to have shifter paddles behind the wheel.. The existence of a stick shift is a plus for me; I think. it's probably much more intuitive to blip the throttle. in GPL while moving my hand down to the shifter.. . Four round buttons are on the face of the wheel, more like. the NASCAR Sprint in this case except for the buttons being. round.  I can't really tell what the material of the wheel. is like, but since all the Thrustmaster wheels to date have. felt nice, I'm sure it won't be a major issue.  It seems at. least to be padded.. . Best of all, with an MSRP of $179, and an actual selling. price in our store of $169.99, it well undercuts Microsoft's. unit.  Unfortunately it doesn't come with software as good. as Microsoft's (CART Precision Racing and Monster Truck. Madness 2).  It only includes the failure Johnny Herbert's F1.. . The wholesale cost at which I could get one is $130, and that. makes it very tempting indeed, considering I spent $149 for. my T2 a few years back.  My brother just got a computer and. he needs a steering wheel.  I've been thinking if I get a. force feedback wheel, I'd give him my T2.

0	Only 1 true good area on NASCAR
Revoloution, the graphics.	Lets start with the crap.  I'm talking NASCAR Revoloution.  I have just. proudly uninstalled NASCAR Revolution Demo from my computer.  If the. game plays better than the demo I have to say to EA "If its in the game,. why ain't it in the demo?".  Only 1 true good area on NASCAR. Revoloution, the graphics.  There are minor glitches in graphics but. otherwise they look great.  The minor flaws in graphics, crash damage. looks awful, cars look too rounded at the bottom, and a few other minor. things.  But, then there is the controlls.  In opinion very arcade. like.  No front tire squeeling due to turning to much and the car can't. handle it, able to turn at high speeds after starting a corner.  Car. turns rather well, not that it is rather real, on flat areas.  Easily. able to cream the road courses' record times probably.  Anouncers are. annoying (luckly in full game you should beable to turn them off). Car. gets 90% to fliping over, with plenty of momentum left and than flips. back on to wheels, little dammage done.  and when the car does roll it. always lands on its wheels and thers absoulty no damage on the roof, not. even a scratch.  EA, step away from NASCAR and get back to what your. good at (Hockey, Baseball, Golf, Football(of all sorts), Soccer, ect.).. Final verdict: "Yo, EA,  Looks ain't everything a game needs.". . What I'm very impressed with tho is SBK.  What a sweet game.  This is. the true competitor to Castrol-Honda and it has already beaten it in my. mind, 1 month before release.  But watch out, Makers of CHSBK (Castrol. Honda SuperBike Champions) are back with SBK2, which supposedly have. full right to the SBK name, tracks, drivers, bikes and more.  And. possiably based on the '99 season.  Any way back to EA's SBK.  Some. people say that they wouldn't get this game due to it's demo in arcade. mode.  I think this is just a sign of whats coming.  They will add in. all the little things like loosing the bike easier and more. realisticly.  Just wait for the full and get it, even if you get it. warez sytle, its only in arcade mode right now, but I assure you Ill pay. the cash.  Love the turning, very realistic to my mind (and it is only. arcade mode right now).  Graphics look astounding.  Perfect job with the. shadows.  Menu Screen setup is great, (forgot to say but I dont like. NASCAR Revolution's Menus, sounds are crap, looks ugly, ect.) easy to. move through and looks nice.  Love the little things, shaking your fist. at drivers who hit you, and you (the player). doesn't have to do any thing for that to happen.  Nice crashes.  All I. have to say is good things about this game.  If i had to complain about. this thing is that the gravel traps are very unrealistic to ride. through.  Just work on that bit and all would be great and maybe a few. other minor things, like add announcers (for people who like that. thing), make sure season runs properly (2 25-lap races per round.  both. worth points.).  Also sweet intro video placed with the demo, hope. that's used with the full game(maybe even a bit longer).  Final. verdict: "Look for me in stores the first day this hits the shelves.". . Thats all I've gotta say.  I could care less about what you think of SBK. cause I know its the bomb, but If youve got any comments you wish to. tell me about either game send them in to my e-mail, djfil@idmail.com. .

The seed was planted long ago actually. N2 has a very large online community. although it's a differnet setup and you have to pay to play. The first. racing game I played online was POD by Ubi Soft. Not great performance. compared to today, but it was impressive (and fun) at the time (year and a. half ago). MS released CPR a year ago and that was the first sim to provide. convenient, free, online TCP/IP racing. MTM2 was released 6 months later and. the quality improved. There has been a very large online racing community. for the MTM titles for almost 2 years. MCM was the latest racing game. released by MS and also has online racing. MS has made internet racing a top. priority in their racing software, and the Zone makes it convenient to find. and set up races.. . Ubi Soft would have had online play with F1RS, but like I said, licensing. issues prevented it. Soon, MGP will have online play with a game service.. I'm sure they will be drawing on their experience with POD.. . To be honest, I really don't think TOO many conclusions about sims can be. drawn from what you read on r.a.s. It's such a small sample. A sim can sell. a half million copies, but the same 200 names appear here at r.a.s. month. after month. It's surprising how many familiar names I see when doing. anything sim related, online. Even in beta testing, most of the names have. been familiar.. . One thing that's kind of interesting for me is that I see some of the same. hardcore online sim racers while moving form one sim to another. There are a. number of guys that raced CPR who are now in GPL. I looked at the qualifying. results for Zandvoort at Randy Magruder's league web page and the top two. guys (Art and Sandman) were also the top racers in CPR. There were a few. others from CPR there too. Art is someone who I also remember from POD.. Actually, if I were asked who I thought were the best online sim drivers,. I'd pick Sandman and Art.. . What I've always felt is that online racing and internet play go perfectly. together. After all, real car racing is all about going head to head with a. human competitor on the track. One thing you can see on r.a.s. with regards. to GPL and online play is that there are some people who are experiencing. online racing for the first time and really enjoying it. When MGP releases. their online service, you'll see more of the same. Once people try online. racing, it quickly becomes addicting.  :-) So while the seed was planted. awhile back, I do agree with you that it will grow quickly form here on out.. .

I believe it comes from not having any outside references. to back up what your inner ear is telling you is going on.  It's something that. will probably go away after a few lessons and a few hours under the hood when. what you're reading on the instrument panel begins to become more familiar to. you.. . As an instructor, it was always something I watched for in new instrument. students, particularly when we were doing stalls, steep turns and unusual. attitudes under the hood.  That's one reason why I usually kept the first few. flights under the hood to an hour at most.  The last two instrument students I. had both had slight motion sickness problems early on.  When I noticed signs of. discomfort, I'd ask, "How ya doin' over there?"  If the response was not so. good, I'd have them take the hood off.  The problem would go away within a few. minutes.. . If the problem recurs during future lessons, just let the instructor know. you're not feeling well and you'd like to take the hood off for a few minutes. . I'm sure there will be no objection.  Most instructors I know (including me). aren't interested in dealing with the potential consequences of motion sickness. if they don't have to.

	Mail ordered it from www.interactcd.com in California last Friday, and it. arrived in the mail on Tuesday via $3 priority mail..... . Installed it last night, and as you might expect I  didn't get much sleep. once I started playing it :-). . What an awesome sim/game! Loads of fun, reminds me of ToCA in the woods on. speed! Has better graphics, physics and tweakable settings for the cars. unlike the rather arcade flavor of ToCA or games like NFSIII where you have. no car setup at all! It also has real car damage which you have to repair. between stages, but your only given a limited amount of time to work on the. car if you damage it, so you have to be selective about what you want to fix. or tweak (assuming there is no damage, but you just want to improve. handling, etc...) I find this a rather challenging and authentic aspect of. the game, but not so annoying as to spend hours and hours changing intricate. care setups in order to shave off a second or less from a lap time (ala,. GPL, CPR, F1RS, etc...). . If your into Rally racing, and have been waiting for this one to come out in. the stores / retail here in the USA, DON'T!. . Go out and order it on the web now! It cost $42.95 w/shipping, but ordering. over the phone or over the net means NO TAXES, so the shipping cost offsets. the regular retail cost.. . Before I ordered it, I called around to places like Babages, CompUSA, Best. Buy, Microcenter, etc... and no place here in Dallas had even heard of it,. much less had it on their list of upcoming software titles! They didn't even. have any news on the Playstation version (which I would assume will hit the. USA market first!). . Not trying to sound like a commercial for Codemasters or CMR, but if you. enjoy driving a racing sim, more than playing armchair mechanic/engineer. like many sims require, but want more than just an arcade racer like NFSIII,. then you'll love this game!. . Cheers!. Jay J. . . .

R:. . Thus brings up my old second point. Do you make a game only a few can drive?. Or a game where the majority can drive like only a few can? I think the. people (the people) want the second, they want to believe they are a world. class driver and can compete on a world class level (there still is a. challange believe me). My ultimate point with this is to have a TOGGLE where. you can have it both ways. I would bet the farm the majority of people who. would buy the game IF IT WERE KNOWN would choose the easier and safer. driving model. N2 arcade was setup wrong and not really mentioned. But. everyone I shown that wasn't a complete die hard simmer liked it much better. and those people out numbered the simmer over 10 to 1.. . Obviously this isn't Papy's goal but this game is getting hyped that a. commoner would assume it's fantastic, but many would get it and find it. undriveable.

As far as the argument being bankrupt to the more sophisticated. simmer, I have to disagree with such a strong statement. I have 2000+. hours of flight time, and hold instrument and commercial ratings in both. fixed and rotary winged aircraft. Perhaps I'm going out on a limb here. but I think I might qualify as one of your "more sophisticated simmers".. . The point I was trying to make was that there are good aspects of this. sim as well as bad. Flight model is not it's high point when compared to. other sim's on the market right now, however it is not as terrible as. everyone makes it out to be if they are flying as if they would fly the. actual aircraft. . .

The above is true for wheels that use the joystick interface (which is left. over from 1981 and a bit of a joke).  The MS FF wheel uses the MPU401 MIDI. interface which is completely different and rock solid (and uses the same. connector/port).

A lot of turbulence with the winds and I. until I get some altitude and good airspeed I hate the thought of engine out. and not enough of either to get back to the runway.  Miramar has no land left. around the airport to land.. It is all homes, 1000' TV towers and narrow. streets.  Sometimes I think I MUST BE CRAZY, WHY AM I DOING THIS?  But I feel I. am past the point of return. I can't quit after all this time, study and. expense, besides it is a life long dream. Any way congrats to you.  Good luck. toward your checkride.

0	Powerful stuff!	What I think would be *really* useful is to have four pairs of concentric. circles (i.e. friction circles) on the screen.. . Each inner circle would enclose a force vector that would grow in size in. proportion to the magnitude of the force acting at each respective corner of. the car. Each enclosed vector arrow would point in the direction of the. resultant force acting at each corner of the car, so you could get a clear. indication of how the forces at each corner were being consumed: braking,. cornering, traction, or some combination of these forces.. . The outer circle in each concentric pair would change in diameter also and. would be proportional to the adhesive force available at each respective. corner based on current wheel loading. When the diameter of the inner circle. grew to match the diameter of the outer circle, you'd know that you had. reached the limit of adhesion. Powerful stuff!. . These vector circles could be displayed in the Replay view and would be. incredibly valuable in analyzing both your own, as well as other driver's,. setups and driving styles. Seems that I've heard rumors that some of this. data is in fact retained in the replay files.. . Graphically, it would be relatively easy to implement. Heck, I might even. consider doing it myself, if Papy chose to make the data available. Randy?. . . .

I don't buy this.  I have had a runaway electric trim in a C310, and that's . pretty darn heavy on the elevators.  I'm no muscleman, but I could hold it OK (at . least till I found the breaker)  That was at cruise speed.  In a spin, the . airspeed is a lot slower, and the trimtab correspondingly weaker.  ISTM that it . would be an exceptional GA aircraft where trim could not be overpowered (or an . exceptionally weak pilot!).  If you are talking about big aircraft after an . hydraulic failure, that's a fish of a different kettle :-). . > Then, not all planes trim with a tab on the elevators. > T.E.  Some move the horz.Stabs. L.E. up or down to control pitch trim.. . True, I'd forgotten about this type of trim.  In this case, it at least makes . aerodynamic sense that the trim could affect maximum "down" elevator authority.  . It still doesn't ring true to me that it would be rigged so as to have a travel . great enough to prevent a spin recovery - I would have thought that this would . prevent certification, but I'm open to correction.  I would imagine that if so, . it would be very clearly stated in the POH, and probably placarded as well.. . >      One or our main flying mags., only a few months ago, ran a story on this. > very condition during a pilot report on an aircraft.

Yes, I would like to see this article.  As long as it's not the same mag. that . ran the "downwind turn" story a while back :-)  Do you recall what type of . aircraft and trim system it was?  Or whether it was a certificated or . experimental aircraft?. . Some aircraft exhibit unusual control forces in a spin, that can give the wrong . feedback to the pilot.  My aircraft has a strong sideways stick force (that can . result in the pilot not centreing the ailerons properly), and also has an . interesting aerodynamic "block" on the elevators as you push forwards to break . the stall.  It feels as if you have come up against the forward stop, but by . pushing a bit harder, you get quite a bit more travel.  It is mentioned in the . POH.  The spin will not recover unless you push through this "block" - but you . *must* wait for the spin to stop before applying forward stick.  Applying down . elevator too early prevents recovery.  Unlike many GA trainers, where it seems . that the spin stops whatever order you do things (or if you do anything at all!), . some aircraft need to be recovered by applying the standard technique *exactly* . as stated.  It's possible that a pilot unfamiliar with the aircraft may see one . phenomena (say an aerodynamic "block"), and think that it was due to another . effect (say the trim).. . >      Also, I still have not seen any reason posted for doing stalls with use of. > "trim only".

1	Right rudder adds to the force driving the BACK of the airplane down and
left... which forces the nose up and right... and if you need to input some
down elevator to keep your speed up, you have cancelled out the "down" force of
the Rudder and then the Rudder is mostly providing the force turning the nose
to the right, which is countering the tendency to turn into the low wing.	. >MCL757 wrote:. >> I disagree, the opposite rudder is what is forcing the airplane away from. >the. >> moving in the direction of the low wing...

Could it be that you only see the blue flag when. you have to let someone pass? In multiplayer this would mean that the. driver to be passed would see the blue flag, but the other one wouldn't.. .

Yep, this car had severe reliability problems. In the 11 races, Gurney. and the occasional teammates started 16 cars.  As you mentioned, Gurney. finished two races, a win at Spa and a third at Mosport.  None of his. teammates finished a race (McLaren three DNF's, Scarfiotti one, and. Pease one).  Actually, Pease was still running at the end of his one. race for Eagle (at Canada), but he was 43 laps down so I assume he had. some mechanical problem! And there seemed to be a different type of. failure at every race - suspension (twice), fuel pump, fuel injection,. fuel leak, ignition, clutch,  halfshaft, oil leak, engine (three times -. twice at Monza - Scarfiotti after 5 laps and Gurney after 4!), radiator.. . I'd be wary to use this car in a series that uses full race lengths.. . It was definitely one of the quicker cars, though.  Gurney qualified. second twice, third three times, fourth once, and fifth three times.. . Dave Ewing.

LG is using. 100x100 miles data; Fly! covers the whole earth and even the poles. seemlessly. If you can model an Earth with a total realistic scenery,. well show it to me; I want it yesterday! :+). .     It's really easy to criticize a product when we are in front of. the screen and we play the sim. But start doing a sim, and give me. some news. LG has less blurry images, but with an area that is so. small, it's kind of easy to understand!. .     For the "insult my intelligence" comment, you are insulting mine!. :+). If you are a sim developper or any game developper, then It's even. less understandable. If you aren't, it's understandable. Go and visit. a sim company, not a store, and look at how the real thing works;. playing doesn't get you the knowledge of how it works.. .     Finally, yes FU3 has really nice textures, and we'd all like to. see every sim like that. Look at the whole armada of combat sim; which. one doesn't have any blurry effect? That's what I thought!. .     Oh! and please compare the features that any civilian sim has with. Fly! And don't pay attention to a 2 line preview, read all of them and. get back to me with your opinion. Aren't you at Yale? Aren't we taught. to never criticize a subject when we didn't read enough about it?. .     Please do not think that I am in TRI's pay list, I only take the. side of the developpers, as I am. Before being an animator, it was. darn easy to criticize, until the time I went in the other side; the. one that makes the things happen!. . Take care  and hope to get your feedback after an extensive reading of. the most impressive list of advanced features included in a civilian. sim.. . --. Jean-Francois Lepage.

But i am happy to. look at other setups or discuss them to get ideas and talk about the. logic behind the settings people have, etc.. I'm down to 59.55s for a lap now - the car is getting even better and. better to drive:) in fact, i can't tell the difference between the. feel of the car in full Sim mode compared to Intermediate mode.

1	Right away, I felt good.	At 24.5 hrs dual, I soloed at Allaire Airport, Belmar NJ.  I knew the. solo was coming because of the pre-solo written and the pre-solo. checkride (my school requires a checkride with a different CFI), I. just didn't know when. I arrived today for a typical lesson and my. CFI, Juliette Watt, asked me how I felt. I knew what she meant and. told her I feel just fine . She then said, " this is THE day"...... I. let that "sink in" for a while, took a deep breath, and  proceeded to. tune in AWOS and  heard a wonderful sound......winds at 8, 310 deg,. coming almost right smack down runway 32. Right away, I felt good.. Walking out of the FBO onto the field to pre-flight, I noticed how. blue the sky was and how beautiful it looked.....I always looked at. the sky before, but, today, for some reason, I really saw it for the. first time in quite a different way......Very soon I would be there,. alone, me in it, and it around me................................... We departed the pattern for some steep turns and 360's for a little. warm up, went over emergency procedures and then Juliette said to head. back to do 2 touch and goes and then a full stop. I knew she was. expecting nice patterns and safe landings and thats what I tried to. do. All three were a little flat . I knew I could do. better......Pulling the plane off the active, she asked for my medical. and logbook and said, Are you ready? I told her I felt good, she. signed the papers, wished me luck, grabbed her flight bag and reached. for her handheld and advised me that she would be in radio contact. with me if the need presented itself. Then she was gone.....Man, how. big that 152 looked inside with her gone!! (quiet too, just kidding. Juliette).....I taxied to the hold-short, looked and listened for. traffic, (uncontrolled airport) , and then I said " Allaire traffic,. cessna 50 BRAVO is taking the active runway, 32, at allaire.. Yep, this was for real......power in full, rolling, airspeed active,. holding center line, ROTATE, and WHOOSH........UP UP UP..........The. plane feels so light and fast.......at 700ft where I usually start a. crosswind., I realize if I turn now I will be way to. tight......Extending the runway heading a bit does the trick......Im. back at my usual visual cues and feel good......downwind I stay at. 1000ft and start picturing the landing....Wait......don't get too far. ahead......You still have alot of things to do.....I take a deep. breath......ok......Im abeam the numbers, power back, carb heat, wait. for the white arc, 10 deg flaps, its all coming together, left base ,. 20 deg , a little high, power adjustment. ok....final 30 deg, I'm. looking good.......numbers locked in position and getting bigger.. Runway is made, idle power, rounding out, and flying over the runway. nice and level....When will I stop?.....I check to see if I pulled all. the power then realize the plane is much lighter now, ( a little. lighter, Juliette)........patience.....patience....patience.......I. land slightly flat but decent......Cessna 50 BRAVO is on the go for #. 2 circuit..........on final I decide to go around as a landed plane is. procrastinating  on the runway for unknown reasons and I bank to the. right of the active when I see the plane on the runway start to take. off......Oh man....this isn't good......I know he doesn't see. me......maybe NORDO.....found out later that he was a student doing. t+g's and didn't announce his intentions........I tell him he has. traffic, ME, at his 3 oclock...he acknowledges. I get back to flying. the plane and he disappears at my 6......Next landing is more relaxing. and less flat.....Third circuit is gonna be my best..........Final. approach, round out........flying over the runway.....hold it...hold. it.........flare...................stall warning buzzer starts a. little chirp.......mains down........back pressure..........nose. gently falls.......a greaser........Did I just do this?  ( I'm smiling. right now just thinking about it)................ Now, I just about ready to start learning how to fly and look forward. to reading the posts here that have helped me greatly  to reach this. point.............Thanks to all who post , for it is up to you, the.

There is a magazine that the Scouts get, (Boys Life???) and in the. back you can find a couple people who are "specialists" in the pine. wood derby cars.  They will provide to you (for a price, silly) some. NICE equipment help to give you a Penske unfair advantage.. Specifically, they have a "how to" book that details it all out.  They. also have microscopically turned axles with lubrication groves cut. into them to replace the 'nails' found in the kits.  They have some. microscopically turned wheels with trued centers to replace the molded. +/- .125: units found in the kits <grin>.. . Trickiest, were the wheels that were trued, and lathe cut so that they. ran on a very tiny ridge to eliminate most rolling. resistance....<grin>. . GET THIS STUFF!. . >Things I do know:. >. >You should add lead weights to get the car up to the maximum weight (5. >oz. I think).. >. MUST be at 5 oz...build it slightly over and using the "official. scales"  at the race dig out enough lead to pass tech.  I drilled a. hole, melted some sheet lead, and poured it in.. . >You can use a dry lubricant on the axles.. >. Molibdium Disulfide (Moly) is best.  Be generous.  And. repeat...repeat.......till the missus get's mad about the spots in the. uniform.. . >Questions:. >. >Does the car need to be balanced in any particular fashion? That is,. >should the weight be distributed evenly around the midpoint or set to. >the front, etc.?. >. Technically, the further the 'weight' falls, the more gravity will. work on the model.  However, from experience, the typical cub scout. 'track' is a little rough.  A car we built had a problem of popping a. wheelie and jumping the track when it hit a crack since the weight was. all in the back.  I'd recommend centering the mass between the axles.. . >Any special aerodynamic considerations as to the shape of the car?. >. naw.....wedge is easy to cut....  DON'T narrow the width at the axle. area.. . >Anything else?. >. yeah....  my experience says that getting the axles 'straight' is a. key.  The kit manual says to "bend" them to make the car roll. straight.  Horse pucky...you don't see Roger Penske bending HIS axles. with a sledge hammer.  Make sure you put them in straight to start.  I. did this by -. 1)  getting some brass tubing with an ID that fits the OD of the axles. = easy to get at the hobby store.. 2)  Using a miter saw to perfectly cut  grooves into the body, across. the body at a 90 degree angle and to equal depth for the axles.. 3)  Set the brass tubing in the slot and glue and fill.. 4)  File off the ends of the brass tubing flush with the body.. 5)  Using epoxy, glue the special axles into the brass tubes.. . Also, we found that the cars actually gain speed with "running in".. So, go find a nice 'test track' and allow the car to make several. passes.  Re-Lube, and repeat.  Make sure that the car is running. straight.  Adjust if necessary, and relube...  Keep it up.. . During ALL of this, it's best NOT to let the cub scout touch the darn. thing.  They have a habit of racing them across the floor and seeing. what other toys they can crash into.  Doing so will bend the axles out. of alignment -- guaranteed.  If you drop it, you've got to start over.. . Oh....let the cub scout choose it's shape - it won't matter - and let. him add any driver or other add ons like exhaust pipes, flames, and. stickers to his heart content.  Most dads think that they KNOW. something about painting and finishing so they put their time and. energy into that - and it shows.. . However, Jr Roger Penske that YOU are, you can be sneaky.  Put YOUR. effort into making it run, and let the cub scout make it look as ugly. as possible <grin>....  victory is all the sweeter that way.. . Dick. . PS  Don't forget to put plenty of lube between the wheels and the body. where they rub....... .

1	This includes 600 (20% of total) gallons of oxygen.	All. Some related information:. Hypoxia. . An adult will breath in 3,000 gallons (by volume) of air per day. . This includes 600 (20% of total) gallons of oxygen. Your blood. system has 25+ trillion (12 zeros) red blood cells (hemoglobin). . Each one is capable of loading up four oxygen molecules for. distribution throughout the body. when returning to the lungs for . a refill they unload CO2 first.. . Hypoxia is oxygen starvation. Lack of oxygen impairs the whole . body but most importantly the brain. The first part of the body. to show significant effect from oxygen deficiency is the retina . of the eye. Every individual is affected but in different ways . and to different degrees. The danger in hypoxia is that it occurs . insidiously below the conscious threshold. Hypoxia makes you happy. and such happiness in the cockpit is very dangerous. The best . warning indicator for hypoxia is the altimeter. You will quickly. recover by descent to a lower altitude.. . Since hypoxia is due to reduced barometric pressure, low-grade . hypoxia begins on takeoff. The percentage of oxygen is same. but less is reaching the blood stream. Any stress or increase . in activity requires more oxygen, up to 8 times more. Pilot. performance deterioration begins at takeoff, as well. Slowed . response times and inability to deal with complexities due to. hypoxia compromise safety. Noticeable oxygen deficiency effects . begins at 4000 safety margins are beginning to erode.. Hypoxic symptoms of difficulty breathing or headache may not be . obvious or may not occur at all even though there are the. foregoing changes in mental status.. . I have seen complete personality changes occur after a couple of . hours around 12,000. Symptoms such as headache,. drowsiness, dizziness, euphoria, tingling, perspiration, or . belligerence are typical. Tunnel vision and blue fingernails occurs . with times as little as 15 minutes above 15,000. At 16,000 . disorientation, lapses of judgment, loss of impulse control, risk-taking. behavior, decreased problem solving abilities, impaired memory, . mood disturbances, and lowered coordination are common.. Unconsciousness occurs in 10 minutes at 20,000.. . All effects are made worse and happen at lower altitudes with . fatigue, age, smoking, health habits, and drinking. Oxygen. recommended above 10,000 day and 5,000 night. If oxygen is . being used, the pilot must be knowledgeable about the operation. of the system and be able to recognize his and the systems . warnings of oxygen deficiency. FARs require oxygen if 1/2. hour above 12,500, crew above 14,000, everybody above 15,000.. . Gene. . I have observed a total personality change in students at altitude..  .

The important thing about oval racing is staying in. one gear which uses the power part of the bandwidth across the rev range of the. engine. At Loudon I have found the Ferrari to be very good with its power range. across the middle of the rev range.. Anyway my 4pennies worth..

0	If the car was
still running at the end, I just added the number of laps completed.	. In helping me decide about which car to use in an off-line series, I did. some research a while back as to the reliability of the various cars. from the actual 1967 season. Here are my results ..... . First I looked at the percentage of laps completed.  To calculate this I. added the number of laps each car actually completed to get the. numerator.  The divisor is a little more complicated.  If the car was. still running at the end, I just added the number of laps completed. . Similarly, if the car was in an accident, I just added the number of. laps completed.  If the car had a mechanical DNF, I added the total. number of laps in the race.  There are some minor flaws in this - you. can get a 100% reliability rating if you crash out early; problems that. cause the car to dramatically slow, but still allow the car to finish,. are not reflected, etc.  Here are my findings for this approach:. . 1) Ferrari 95.7%. 2) Brabham 89.7%. 3) Honda 80.2%. 4) Cooper 68.8%. 5) Lotus 68.1%. 6) BRM 64.5%. 7) Eagle 36.4%. . Second, I looked at the percentage of DNFs.  If a car crashed out, I did. not count it at all for the race.  So this calculation is the number of. times the cars was running at the end divided by the number of starts. for the car minus the number of times the car DNF'ed due to an accident. (not a mechanical failure).  . . 1) Ferrari 85.7%. 2) Brabham 81.8%. 3) Cooper 58.5%. 4) Honda 55.6%. 5) BRM 41.9%. 6) Lotus 40.9%. 7) Eagle 18.8%. . No matter how you look at it, Ferrari and Brabham were by far the most. reliable cars and the Eagle was down right pitiful.  As bad as the Lotus. looks in these figures, it was actually even worse because a few times. Clark was leading only to have a non-fatal malfunction that cost him the. lead, but didn't cause a complete DNF.. . I hope someone finds this interesting and/or useful.. . Dave Ewing.

0	already posted.	I was over at a friends house last night, and He downloaded GSB and. basically had no problems at all.  So, I get home and from the VROC site, I. see there is a new version (or just a patch?) already posted.  I do not. believe he got the new version, due to the fact that he got it from the Pits. site.  On to my problem!  I read that I needed WinSock 2.2 and downloaded. the ver. checker to find out I only had 1.1. Downloaded WinSock 2.2 and. installed it. I did not restart the computer because GSB was still. downloading.  When GSB finished, I installed it then restarted my computer.. When my system was back up, I connected to the Net and then started GSB.. First problem I got was a, "File Not Found" error.  What file? The other. problem, may or may not be a problem. I closed GSB, to see if it just needed. to be restarted, and another ver. of GSB running / or the first did not. close, it just minimized. I open it up, and that one won't shut down.  I. have to do a Ctrl-Alt-Del to actual end the task.  Any ideas?  I read. earlier, that the patch fixed the file not found problem. Is this the old. version, and there was only a patch?  What about the other problem, is it. just a connection issue? I never did get it to connect to VROC. Oh, my. friend, seemed to not have any problems. Any suggestions would be greatly. appriciated.. .

0	Too bad about those pedals...

Kevin Caldwell
Calgary, Canada


	Hi,. . Just thought I'd share my opinions on my Logitech Formula (non-force. feedback) wheel and pedal set I just got. I agonized over getting the force. feed back model, but since GPL is the only driving sim I like, and I've. heard some less-than-glowing reports on the state of FF at this time, I went. with the plain model. Plus I plan on modifying the hell out of it, and it. will likely be easier without the FF complications.. . First, why I bought the Logitech: the wheel. The wheel itself is just about. perfect, and better for driving sims than fancy Momos with buttons grafted. on them, IMHO. The shift paddles are large and well place, it has 4. perfectly located buttons, and the wheel itself feels great - perfect. thickness and nice  contouring.. . I have been using a TM GP1 for about 4 months of heavy GPL use. I had. modified it for 270 degree rotation, removed the centering bungie entirely,. and made new clamps so I could still use my keyboard tray. The GP1, while a. bit cheap feeling and wobbly, works surprisingly well. The analog hand. clutch is excellent, and the thumb shift buttons, while not as nice as shift. paddles, work well. I had mated it to a pair of CH non-Pro pedals, with a. slit tennis ball strategically taped under the brake pedal, and they also. work quite well. The 270 degree rotation eventually fatigued all the wires. in the curly cord, and I thought shift paddles and some glance buttons on. the wheel would be nice.. . The Logitech pedals aren't quite as bad as I thought they'd be, but they are. close. The travel is too short, they have little feel, and the position is. too vertical. The only thing that makes them useable is the adjustable. sensitivity in the Logitech control panel. Even adding some feel to them via. heavier springs, rubber hoses, etc., can't get around the lack of travel and. poor position. I am going to splice in my CH pedals until I build some. better ones.. . I am also going to increase the rotation of the Logitech to 270 degrees, and. lighten the centering (I hope, haven't actually seen how that works yet).. GPL needs the precision that the increased rotation provides, or at least I. do when driving it! I also hate fighting heavy centering for lap after lap. of road courses in GPL. I also hope to build a better base for the wheel,. with some real ball bearings to get rid of the slop in the steering wheel. shaft, and a clamp design that will work with a keyboard tray. Where do. these guys think your keyboard goes to?. . The Logitech wheel is lovely, and I got onto the shift paddles in about two. laps. A split paddle on the left with an analog hand clutch would be. perfect, but I can live with an on/off clutch button since the GPL clutch. basically works that way in any case. The stock condition wheel feels more. precise while driving GPL, than the GP1. Even unmodified, it is a pretty. decent wheel. Too bad about those pedals.... . Kevin Caldwell. Calgary, Canada. . .

Of course, once again, this is one of these odd acronym that. doesn't have a term for it.  About 15 years ago the FAA changed. it just to FLIGHT REVIEW.  This was because when they added. the RECREATIONAL certificate (which has been an overwhelming. success as you can see by the numbers) they changed the then. Biennial (every two years) flight review to annual for low. time pilots to appease the flight instructor lobby.. . The reg (61.57) says Flight Review (no indication of time).. . Fortunately, the FAA kept putting off the effective date of. the rule until they finally gave up on the concept and. nuked it.  The term remains FLIGHT REVIEW..

Depends on much you are willing to spend.  At the very least you could. keep your card and put in a V2 card.  My personal recommendation is to. buy a good 2D/3D D3D  AGP card and put a V2 card next to it.  That is. what I did, I play a lot of 3dfx (or GLide) games.  If you plan on. upgrading to a Celery the new board you get will almost certainly have. an AGP slot anyway.  Heck you can one of the new TNT cards for $160 (I. think) and V2 cards are coming way down in price.  The V2 card scales. very nicely with PII processors anyway, so until games increase. dramatically thier fill rate requirements, a V2 card will go along way. in your new system.  A good 2D/3D card in combo with a V2 card will. give you complete compbatility with all games with up to date. performance.  I personally use a Diamond G460II in concert with a. Diamond Monster 3DII 8Mb.. . As far as a new processor and MB, try and go for a 300a instead of the. 266.  Mimimal difference in price and will overclock slightly better. and has (I think) 256 L2 cache.  Go for the ABIT BH6 motherboard.  It. lends itself very well to overclocking, you can do all adjustments. from the BIOS software, no jumpers on the MB.   I use the. predecesssor, the ABIT LX6.. . Fans??  As many as you want.  Heat is the ALLTIME enemy for any. electronic component. Everything in the case creates heat.  I have. four fans in my system, fan in the power supply, two fans on the. processor, and a seperate case fan.  Fans are cheap insurance.  Since. you plan on OC your Celery, the more heat yo can radiate off the. processor the better off you are going to be.  OC creates even more. heat than normal in the processor, and if you can keep it cool, the. more chance you will have at a stable overclocked system.   Make sure. you have a good strong power supply however,.  the more fans you run. the more power you suck up.  I would suggest at least a 275 W power. supply.  . . Hope this helps in your decision!!. . Wheels down, pointy end forward!!. Steve   (remove NO-SPAM to e-mail).

> You can use a dry lubricant on the axles.	Potential Energy (PE) = mgh where m is mass, g is gravity (constant) and h. is your height.. . Kenetic Energy  (KE) = 1/2 m(v squared) where m is mass and v is velocity. . while the car is at rest you have PE.  When it moves this converts to KE, so. PE ~= KE (accounting for friction loss). . Basically, you can't change g or h as they are controlled by God (g) or the. Cub Scouts of America (h).  They are constant (while at rest).  You can. maximize your mass (m).  This increases your PE which increases your KE. which increases your velocity.. . What you will see between a heavy car and a light car (assuming equal. friction loss), they will both come down the ramp at the same speed. (remember Galileo), but at the bottom the heavy car will pull away from the. light car as it has more KE.. . At least that is what it did for me in 1964 when I entered the Pinebox. Derby.... :-). . -Paul. .

I've run out of fuel two or three times despite filling the car with. supposedly enough fuel for the entire race. In each case I had been. overreving and overdriving trying to catch or stay ahead of someone. I. no longer cut the fuel quite as fine as I used to, giving myself a. certain percentage margin.. .

General Game Issues . . o Tunnel at Monaco . . To see the tunnel at Monaco the trackside object settings must be full.. You may won't to check it out pressing the hotkey ALT-D several times. . . o Jerez Starting Lights . . There is a bug in Grand Prix 2. You won't see the starting lights if the. trackside object have been turned off. Press ALT-D to see the starting. lights. . . o Adelaide Invisible Pit Wall . . When you are coming to the pits at Adelaide and you turn in the hairpin. too tightly you'll hit an invisible pit wall. This a way to prevent. taking short cuts. . . o Missing Wet Weather . . Grand Prix 2 does not contain wet weather or any weather variation. . . o Missing 3D Graphics Support . . Grand Prix 2 does not support 3D graphics cards. . . o Missing Network Support . . Grand Prix 2 supports modem and serial link play, but it does not. support network play, e.g. IPX protocol. . . o Track Pack . . Track pack is a commercial add-on disc by Instant Access. You'll have to. buy it from your local shop to get it. If you want to know what it looks. like, you download a demo version from the software page. From their. website you'll get a bug fix patch for their editor. More info at. information page. . . General Game Playing . . o Car in Pits . . If you drive without steering help you can steer in the pit where you. want, but if you drive with steering help your driving is restricted.. Computer doesn't brake automatically. In pits there is 80km/h speed. limit. . . o Controlling the Car . . Pushing too hard on the throttle when coming out of a low-speed corner. will result in a 180-degree spin. If you lock up the brakes, clouds of. smoke can be seen in the rear mirrors and the car begins to slide in the. direction you are facing. You won't be able to control the car until you. release the brakes. Hit the curbs too hard at high speeds and your car. becomes airborne. . . o Stuck in Sand . . You can get out of the sand traps, but you will lose time because the. wheels are spinning causing your car to slowly leave the trap. . . o Selecting Tyres . . You can't select tyre compounds (A,B,C,D) yourself. As in the real '94. season Goodyear makes a choice of tyre compounds and brings only 1 type. to each circuit. . . There are 7 sets of tyres, and the 3 numbers above are how many laps you. have done on each set of practice/qualifying tyres. The r1,r2,r3,r4 are. typically reserved for the race. . . o Basic Car Setup . . The basic thing in the car setup is that you put lots of wings to front. and less to rear. Gear rations depends much there are slow corners and. long straights. . . o Car Slower in Race than in Practise . . GP2 varies the car HP and Grip settings to better simulate real F1. racing conditions. . . o Making a Good Start . . The trick is to have just the right amount of revs as the light goes. green, then accelerate very gently. More info available how to use the. clutch at Tips and Tricks page. . . o Braking and Wheel Locking . . If you are using keyboard its very hard, the best way is to tap the 'Z'. key in quick short bursts. With pedals the best way is to brake hard at. first then gently ease of the brakes as the car slows. . . o Running of Out Fuel . . Altering the quickrace length can affect GP2's fuel calculation, make. sure your setup has automatic pit stops enabled. You may also need to. drive smoother and conserve fuel. . . The fuel consumption data has been saved to the track .DAT files and. they can be changed with a track editor. Download it from the software. page. . . o Extracting Setups from Hotlaps . . Load the hotlap into the Performance Analyser, then exit back to the car. setups screen, the setup should have changed to the one in the hotlap. . . o Saving Lap Records . . GP2 only saves race records on 100% distance, but check out the software. page to find an util to fix this problem. . . o Capturing Screens . . The easiest program to capture screens is PCXDUMP. If you have problems. using this util, check also Universal VESA Driver. This util helps you. with problems with SVGA. (Check out the Software page to find those. utils.) . . To capture the backgrounds without the menus go to the Advanced options. menu, and set the menu delay time to 2.0 secs. . . Game Performance . . o How Fast Computer I Need . . You need at least 486DX 100MHz to play Grand Prix 2. 120MHz Pentium is. recommended. The faster computer you have the nicer the game will run.. However it has been reported that Pentium 200MHz is not enough fast to. run the game in full details. Maybe Pentium 400MHz is enough fast. (?) . . o VGA or SVGA . . If you have 486 - Pentium 133Mhz choose VGA or if you have Pentium. 120Mhz or faster choose SVGA. Of course the menus will shown in. SVGA-mode although you have chosen VGA in race. . . If your display driver does not support SVGA (requires 512kb video. memory) you'll have to start the game in VGA mode: start the game as gp2. video:vga. The menus will be shown now in resolution 640*480*16 and the. race 320*200*256. . . Using VGA mode will damage your monitor, because it'll change the. resolution between the menus and the race. If you feel that your monitor. will break up and it's highly recommended that you'll play the game in. SVGA resolution! . . o Texture Settings . . There are two choices: Get a real driving experience with low graphics. or enjoy the beatiful panoram with high graphics. You'll have to make. that choice your self! But if you want to make a new lap record, frame. rate must 25fps and prosessor occupancy about 60-80%. . . o S3 Accelerator . . This program speeds up transfer rates from video cards with a S3. processor. That means that it will make the game faster if you have S3. video card!!! However, use the util at your own risk! Visit the software. page to download the util. . . o Pentium Pro Accelerator . . 16-bit programs does not run very well with Pentium Pro. Because GP2 is. a DOS game, you will loose some horse powers. There's a util called. FastVid. It should increase the performance. Note! You must load. Universal VESA Driver before using this util. If you have the old. 450-series mother board this util will increase the performance a lot!. Visit the software page to download the util. . . o Universal VESA Driver . . If you have problems with SVGA or taking screen shots, this util will. fix your problems. This util will also make the game faster! Visit the. software page to download the util. . . o No CDROM . . Yes! It possible to play the game without CDROM in the drive! Visit the. software page to download the NOCDROM util. You don't need to use FakeCD. or other corresponding util. . . The TRACKDAT.BIN -file (215Mb) on the CDROM is just a fake and it has no. purpose, except to impede making illegal copies. . . o AMD Processors . . There are no problems running GP2 with AMD processors. GP2 runs amazing. good with AMD K6 200-233Mhz. . . o Cyrix Processors . . There might be some problems running GP2 with Cyrix Processors. Take a. look at Cyrix's home page to find an util to increase performance. . . Editing the Game . . o Using ZIP Files . . If you are using Windows, download WinZIP. It's a very easy program to. use. . . If you are still using DOS, download PKZIP 2.04g. Here are some examples. to use the util. More info can be founded in the documentation. . . PKUNZIP -D ZIPFILE.ZIP C:\PLAAH Uncompress ZIPFILE.ZIP to C:\PLAAH. directory. PKZIP MYFILE.ZIP *.* Compress all files to MYZIP.ZIP file. . . o Using GP2JAM . . You'll need Trevor Kellaway's GP2JAM utility or a JAM manager. Browse. through software page to find a suitable util. Unzip GP2JAM.ZIP to. GP2\GAMEJAMS directory. . . Command line options are: GP2JAM [-bFILENAME.BMP] [-jFILENAME.JAM] . . For example to convert a JAM file to BMP file type: GP2JAM. -jC:\GP2\GAMEJAMS\WILLIAMS.JAM To convert a BMP file back to JAM file. type: GP2JAM -bWILLIAMS.BMP -jC:\GP2\GAMEJAMS\WILLIAMS.JAM . . Notice! To convert a BMP file to JAM file, the JAM file must already. exist and it will be overriden. So, you'll have to know what JAM file. will updated! . . You can convert JAM files easier by using Steven Young's GP2edit. Windows-editor. . . o Painting Cars . . Probably the editor to paint cars is Paint Shop Pro. It's a shareware. program, but it's a very good one! . . The best way to learn to paint is to try make changes to the bitmap and. then look what it'll look like in GP2. . . o Painting Helmets . . Probably the editor to paint helmets is Paint Shop Pro. It's a shareware. program, but it's a very good one! . . The helmet files are in the HELMETS1.JAM file. The best way to learn to. paint is to try make changes to the bitmap and then look what it'll look. like in GP2. . . o Painting Cockpits . . Probably the editor to paint cockpits is Paint Shop Pro. It's a. shareware program, but it's a very good one! . . The best way to learn to paint is to try make changes to the bitmap and. then look what it'll look like in GP2. Don't make any changes to the. palette! . . o Editing and Installing CPD Cockpits . . To install and edit CPD cockpit files, you'll the Cockpit Designer. Editor. Go to software page to download it. . . o Editing Menu Pictures . . To extract and insert menu pictures, you'll the GP2 Hi-Pic util. Go to. software page to download it. Type GP2HIPIC /? to get more info how to. use it. . . o Editing Sounds . . You'll need WAV Extractor/Inserter by Maraich Giorgio. You can extract. the sounds of GP2 from the SAMPLE.CAT file and the convert them to WAV. files. Now you can listen to and edit the sounds. The edited sounds can. be insert back to SAMPLE.CAT. The sound format is 8-bit 22050Hz mono.. Some edited sounds can be found on software page. . . You can change sounds easier by using Steven Young's GP2edit. Windows-editor. After listening all the sounds from SAMPLE.CAT you'll. notice that it includes sounds which the game does not use e.g. "Car. damaged!" "Well done!". These sounds are not used because the game. wasn't completely finished when it was released. . . o Editing Tracks . . There is a track editor available for GP2. Go to software page to. download it. . . To edit and/or play the new tracks, you must have the NoCDROM, GP2NOCD. or Tracks on HD utility installed. Go to software page to download it. . . The tracks are in the HD at GP2\CIRCUITS directory. The file names are. F1CT01.DAT - F1CT16.DAT. F1CT01.DAT = Brazil etc. . . If you want to change the menu track names, you can change them with GP2. Track Manager or other corresponding util. . . Trouble Shooting . . o File Not Found Error Message . . When you are starting a race in GP2 and you'll get a 'File Not Found'. error message as the program tries and reads the track off the CD.. Probably it will happen in all the circuits. The solution to your. problem is to : . .     make a dir gp2\circuits.     cd\gp2.     md circuits. .     copy files from your cdrom.     copy e:\gp2\circuits\*.dat. . You do not need to copy that huge trackdat.bin 215MB file. Just the. track .dat's... then the game will work. This isn't a normal thing to. happen, check your CD-ROM it's most likely about to break. . . o Game Settings Upside Down . . Loading a hot lap will also load game settings from the hot lap, so. probably your game settings will go upside down. But every time you exit. from the game you will receive a question 'save changes?'. You should. answer 'no' and then your settings will remain as they was when you. started the game. Answering 'yes' will save the current changes. . . o Windows 95 Problems . . Because Grand Prix 2 was designed and developed to run under MS-DOS, you. may experience problems running under Windows 95. To achieve optimal. frame rate and performance levels, it is strongly recommended that you. reboot in MS-DOS mode. . . It is important to ensure all necessary CDROM and sound card drivers are. loaded before attempting to run Grand Prix 2. Failure to do so may. result in the game not loading. (They have included the customer service. help documents in a directory called UTILS\HELPDOCS on the CD-ROM.) . . AutoPlay: Some Windows 95 machines do not support AutoPlay. In this. case, please double-click on your CD-ROM icon and then double-click on. the install icon. . . Windows 95 Keyboards: On certain video cards, Windows 95 is unable to. restore certain DOS- based graphical applications such as Grand Prix 2.. This is particularly a problem with the new Windows 95 keyboards. containing the new "Start" and "Windows" keys. If you press these keys,. Windows suspends Grand Prix 2 to bring up a menu but is then unable to. restore the game. The only solution to this problem is to run Grand Prix. 2 in MS-DOS mode. . . Microsoft Plus: To prevent problems running Grand Prix 2, the System. Agent should be disabled. . . o Windows NT Problems . . Grand Prix 2 will only run under Windows NT in VGA mode without sound.. However, the installation program does run under NT, because the. installation program uses straight hard disk writing which is not. allowed in NT. . . o Installation Problems . . If the installation program aborts or fails to copy any files, you may. have either a dirty or faulty CD-ROM. Please clean the CD-ROM disc and. try again. . . Make sure you have enough memory before starting the installation as. outlined in the hardware detection phase. . . Make sure that there are no viruses active and disable any virus. checkers. . . Microsoft CD-ROM extensions (MSCDEX) should be reporting a version 2.23. or higher for Grand Prix 2 to work. . . If you are still having problems, we recommend trying a boot disk. . . o Sound Card Problems . . If the auto-detect program locks up, reset the machine and try. reselecting auto-detect from the GP2 directory. If this again produces a. lockup or crash, try manually selecting your card's IRQ, DMA and Port. settings. If you are unsure as to what these settings are, try typing. "SET" from the command prompt or refer to your hardware manuals. . . If you have a Sound Blaster card, make sure you have the necessary. device drivers loaded in your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.Bat files. It is. also important to have a SET line placed in the AUTOEXEC.BAT. . . If you are experiencing problems with the program locking up or crashing. within the 3-D simulation, it could be because the auto-detect has. wrongly chosen your sound card. Run the sound setup program again by. typing "SETUP" and select "SoundBlaster (original)" or "No Sound." . . Gravis UltraSound: The playback quality of the sound test sample may. sound garbled. This should not affect the playback quality during the. game. . . ATI Stereo F/X: Grand Prix 2 is not compatible with this sound card. If. you have the ATI Stereo F/X, you need to select "No Sound." . . Sound Galaxy Pro and Other Sound Blaster 16 Compatible Cards: The. auto-detect program sometimes wrongly identifies the Sound Galaxy Pro as. a Sound Blaster 16. You must manually select "SoundBlaster" and then. enter the correct Port, IRQ and DMA settings. . . You can also start the game with no sound by typing the following. command line option: "GP2 Nosound." . . o Modem/Serial Link Problems . . In order to successfully connect Grand Prix 2 via modems, it is. necessary to know the correct modem initialization strings to turn error. correction and compression off. We have included some modem. initialization strings within the game, but these are not guaranteed to. work. Look for a newer list of modem strings at the end of this FAQ.. Symptons of incorrect strings are a slow frame rate and possibly a. lockup or crash. . . Linking within Windows 95 can cause the system to momentarily pause. We. recommend running Grand Prix 2 in MS-DOS mode. . . The highest baud rate can cause some systems to momentarily "hang" or. "freeze." Try selecting a lower baud rate such as 19200. . . While linked, the background music will automatically be turned off. . . You may find that you need to significantly reduce the detail level in. order for the game to run at an acceptable frame rate. This is because. the link takes up some processor power. . . Grand Prix 2 has known problems detecting PCMCIA cards. Microprose. apologizes for any inconvenience. . . COM Ports 3 and 4: During testing, Microprose found that some machines. (but not all) failed to recognize the presence of COM ports 3 and 4. To. help solve this, they included a small program called COMSETUP in the. UTILS\COMSETUP directory on the Grand Prix 2 CD-ROM. To run the program,. type "COMSETUP /H" at the DOS prompt. This will bring up a list of. available COM ports, their various port addresses and some help text.. You will need to find out what the hex address for COM ports 3 and 4. are. (This information can be obtained by running MSD or Windows 95.). Once you have this info, you need to enter the values to the end of the. COMSETUP line and rerun Grand Prix 2. COM 4 may now be available. . . Also make sure a mouse isn't plugged into the corresponding COM ports.. For example, if a mouse is plugged into COM 1, you will be unable to. select COM 3 (likewise for COM ports 2 and 4). If this is the case on. your system, try linking without a mouse or use the command line option:. "GP2 linkonmouseport." . . If you don't know your modem's initstring, hangupstring and baudrate,. take a look at your modem's manual. If you have lost it try first:.    INITSTRING=ATZ.    HANGUPSTRING=ATH0.    BAUDRATE=19200. . If you'll get data mismatch errors when linked, it usually occurs when. using modified GP2.EXE files that are different. . . o GP2JAM And Windows 3.1x . . If GP2JAM does not convert the BMP-files under Windows 3.1x, download. WINDPMI.386. Copy it to Windows\System directory. Add the following. lines to the SYSTEM.INI file, into the [386Enh] section:.    DEVICE=WINDPMI.386.    WinExclusive=0. . o Matrox Mystique Problems . . GP2 will crash if you are using old version of Matrox Mystique BIOS.. You'll get an updated version of the BIOS from Matrox's website. . .

Microsoft Plus. --------------. To prevent problems running Grand Prix 2, the System Agent should be. disabled.. . Control Method. ==============. Included on the Grand Prix 2 CD-ROM is a directory called GPFILES that. contains predefined controller files for the ThrustMaster T2 and GP500. race systems. You can use these as examples to set up your own units.. . The joystick port built into the Ensoniq Soundscape has a known. compatibility problem recognizing the GP500 race system (which may. affect other sticks). There's nothing we can do but suggest the use of. a game card.. . Before calibrating a nonstandard joystick, it is important to select . "Control Driven Calibration.". . Make sure you select the correct joystick axis. If the red calibration. dot fails to move, it is more than likely that you selected the wrong. joystick port.. . Be sure to save the controller file.. . How to Set Up a ThrustMaster T2. -------------------------------. From the main menu of Grand Prix 2:. . 1) Select "Control Method.". . 2) Select "Not Used.". . 3) Select "Advanced Menu.". . 4) Select "Joystick A Horiz" for Steering Device.. . 5) Select "Analog" for Steering Mode.. . 6) Select "Joystick B Horiz" for Acceleration Device.. . 7) Select "Analog" for Acceleration Mode.. . 8) Select "Joystick B Horiz" for Brake Device.. . 9) Select "Switched" for Braking Mode.. . 10) Select "Control Driven Calibration" for Control Method.. . Do not touch any other settings. You can edit the set name to say "T2" . or "TMaster" and then save the file.. . Now calibrate the device, and your T2 should work.. . Modem/Serial Link Problems. ==========================. In order to successfully connect Grand Prix 2 via modems, it is. necessary to know the correct modem initialization strings to turn. error correction and compression off. We have included some modem. initialization strings within the game, but these are not guaranteed. to work. Look for a newer list of modem strings at the end of this FAQ..

The original post made no sense to me, and I'm reasonably familiar with. how FS98 works w.r.t. the various aircrafts' flight models.. . The only thing I can think of is that the Mr. Alfie is talking about the. way helicopters *used* to work in previous versions of Flight Simulator. (e.g. v6) , where there was no helo-specific model. Then, perhaps using. a fixed winger's prop pitch control would emulate the action of the. collective. This is not necessary in FS98; the stock '206 *can* be flown. although it's difficult.. . As I said in another FS98 helicopter-related post recently, the best. thing to do is go grab one of the modified helicopter models that Ian. Standfast has done and plug that into the '206 folder; they're available. at http://members.aol.com/keitht777/helipad.html and/or. http://www.chariot.net.au/~pwinwood/. You'll find these to be eminently. more flyable than the original '206 one.. . Dave Blevins.

Here's a tip that saves me time - copy your checklists and tape them to the. clipboard. Make sure the. Emergency Checklist is on the back ready in an instant. I also put the.

They were concerned that, in case of engine failure, the pilot wouldn't. (perhaps after the conventional 4 sec to ask himself wha' happen') wouldn't. have enough elevator authority to be able to pitch down and assume Vbg. But. the POH has speed at 50' LESS than Vx.

I was doubtful about. the conditions, and perfectly willing to call it off for the day if she saw. fit for that, but after everything was considered, we decided on a go. It's. really nice (and unusual for me considering my previous CFI's) to have. somebody display a little confidence in me. The trends were clearly for. rising ceilings and visibility and that's exactly what happened. The lack of. availability for the plane never really came into the decision. If it was. available, I would have called in sick on Saturday and gone if it didn't. look doable Thursday. I've been up with this CFI in 25G40 and I think she. knows what I can handle.. . As for the over the top, this was a small, thin line of clouds. I could see. the shadow from them on the ground and knew that I could have climbed 2000'. at the most to clear them by legal limits and descended immediately after. them. I was a little too close to them for that kind of ascent without. making a 360, so I opted to go under. One of these days I'll get a little. time on top.

The other is a replay of a spin at Monza. where I just kiss the guard rail with my left rear on the exit to. Curva Grande, and force the car to spin to avoid going into the. bushes on the left.  As the car comes around, I turn the front. wheels in the opposite direction so they drag across the Tarmac. rather than roll and snap me into a second spin, and I keep on. the gas, and miraculously save it after just one spin, and get. no slower the whole time than 89 mph.

>bit.	I've been saying this for years. I'm not here to tell the people that if. they like something not to like it. But to understand your view and my view. as more of a commoners view. This is why GPL won't be played as much as it. should. Nascar 2 sold well but there are a lot of people that bought it and. shelved it way to early.. . I believe your logic is so correct that it can not be argued sanely. I. always watched replays as part of my handling review. The one that is by far. the best for realism is Nascar in arcade with heavily modified ai settings.. This was poetry. You could be mistaken easily for an Ai driver lap after. lap. No AA500 there. I also like Toca, but the bumping wasn't realistic. watching replays, but in all actuality really lends itself better that it is. the way it is. Otherwise you would have blow out races and races where only. a few would finish in. Toca in a GP enviroment is absolutley excellent since. they do things to keep the race close unlike all other GP racers I've tried.. . Without some type of added control from GPL I simply will not be able to get. my local gang into this game. The learning curve can not be much higher than. it is to jump into their own auto and drive it fast down the road. They will. become frustrated and ask for N2, Toca, MTM or some other genre.. . I do like the net options they threw in here that I wish N2 had.. . I'm lucky to be blessed with cable modems. I'm setting up my gang with USB. sound (another problem with dos N2) so we can have several sound sources. going at once. There is a program called Honeynet which allows a group of 8. to talk live to one another with a headset across the net while they are. playing their favorite game (works great with CTF Quake). This is only. possible with usb sound unless you don't want game sounds. This is just a. tech. message to some out there that might want to take advantage of this. awesome feature. Having N2 using GPL's netwokring abilities this would be. the shi!.. . But I agree if the replays show the absolute pro's driving insanely on the. track then there has to be someting wrong. I personally have a feeling that. the players who do love it enjoy the challange and find the groove the game. does create even though it isn't really realistic fun to drive even though. it's quite dangerous.. .

Around here, the way it works is you're charged only for Hobbes. time .... but the FBO requires a certain number of Hobbes hrs. per day that you have the plane (usually 3 for a popular plane. like a C172, often less for a more expensive rental which is. less utilized).. . So if you keep the plane 3 days, but only fly 4 hrs, you might. get charged an additional rental fee for 5 hrs you didn't fly.. Sometimes the rental fee will be a normal full rental hour; other. times the additional rental fee will be a discounted percentage..  . So the tendency for the economical renter is, not to fly trips. which won't meet the minimum Hobbes rental per day.  . . Ironically, this means as a renter, it may work out to keep the . plane for a week and fly 1800 miles while keeping the plane for a. weekend and flying 200 miles would be too expensive.. . > I haven't rented yet (still finishing up on the PPL), but I'm . > wondering if it works like some car rentals do ($x/day + "mileage").. .

Yes there are a few nitpicks but no major bugs or other problems.  A very. finished sim, especially from a company with no race sim products.  IMHO this is. the best race sim out today.  NO I'm not saying it is better than GPL(I didn't. have the machine to run GPL so I took it back), it's just one hell of a lot more. fun for me.  It's certainly better than GP2, ICR2, &  NASCAR but on the other. hand they are different type racing sims..   Yes the AI might seem to be a problem because at the lower level they run into. you quite often which makes you drive more defensively but this is very. realistic since you are in the amateur ranks.  As you progress up through the. skill levels the AI get progressively better and more aggressive..

This makes much sense to me if the engine is running - the fuel already present. in the engine should absulutely be burned off.  But my thought in wanting to go. to full lean, in addition to stating that the fuel should be turned to off, was. based on the premise that no further fuel should be introduced to an engine. that is not running - whether it is presently the source of a fire, or whether. it could be the source of a potential fire in a crash landing.

	I wasn't sure about the letterbox version at first , but I think it was a good. choice.  . . I have a few comments about it below:. . 1.  This does inprove framerate as less screen has to be drawn.  GPL is very. CPU dependent game.  . . 2. Harder to see on 15" and below but great on my 17".. . 3.  Much easier to see around a corner with the wide screen format.  . . 4.  I didn't like the fisheye of CART and earlier indycar series.  I prefered. GP2's view to those earlier Papyrus sims.  Hopefully a future GP3 will have a. widescreen option.. . 5. This is just a great game.  No other sim has given me the satisfaction of a. great lap turned.  . 6  The widesceen format allows the steering wheel to be shown fully and that. gives more driver feedback than most would think.  I think the wheel vibrates. as to the amount of grip and also helps you see how much lock your aplying.  . . 7. Best driving SIM to date period!!!. . 8.  How much for that SONY widescreen monitor?. . In summary I give the widescreen a big thumbs up.  . . Jerry.

I didn't get behind the wheel until monday morning.. . This reinforces my own personal minimums, which are "at least 12 hours. since the last drink and no hangover or fatigue."  If I have consumed. heavilly the night before, the latter two requirements generally result. in at least 15 hours lag time, or (more likely) putting off the flight. entirely for a day or even cancelling altogether.. . I have flown twelve hours after having a couple of beers or a glass of. wine with dinner the night before and felt comfortable with it.  I have. also opted to not fly for three days after a major binge.  I flew once. (with a CFI back before getting my PPL) about 9 hours after a night out --. it was a good lesson on why drinking heavilly the night before a flight. is a very bad idea, even if it can be technically legal.

For a passenger, no - I'd want to land at an airport in that case, and maybe . even an airport that has better medical facilities than the closest one.. .

And it is really so simple to make all the non-members who want to. attend into "temporary" Members.  Then there ARE no non-members and. the problem of "non-members" on the flight line goes away!  . . Of course, the REAL problem on the flight line is NOT "non-members". but is rather, one of people who don't know the first thing about. airplanes and have absolutely NO respect for someone airplane.  . . After all, it IS on "display."  How come I can't climb on it or . photograph my kids standing on it?   Clearly, this policy doesn't. do a thing to control this very real and growing problem.  . . I don't bring my airplane there anymore because it is too difficult. to protect my airplane.  I hate to say it, but it is true.  And that. is in spite of the fact that we have a large group who hangs out . together and guards each others airplanes.  We all park together. in the camping area.

From your post,I'm assuming that 38fps is the max one can get from gpl?. Well,I recently upgraded to a K6-2/350 and a motherboard with 100mhz front. side bus with 64mb of SDRAM.

vintage racing engine sounds to make them suitable for GPL.	I've added some exciting new information to my Grand Prix Legends pages.. . . GPL has been named Game of the Year by one magazine and runner-up by. another.. . Steve Smith has added a new chapter to his Advanced Setup Guide.. . New sound samples created by a GPL fan named Patrick (and available at. his site) transform GPL's audio environment.  Patrick processed actual. vintage racing engine sounds to make them suitable for GPL.  With. Patrick's sounds, you can hear every cylinder fire.  The BRM shrieks,. the Murasama bellows and howls, the Coventry moans and whines, the. Ferrari wails, the Brabham roars, the Lotus and Eagle snarl.  The result. is a raw, visceral experience that evokes the sensations I've previously. experienced only at real race tracks.  If you're a GPL fan, you have. *got* to try these sounds!. . Spurred by Achim Trensz' suggestion, I've installed a SoundBlaster Live!. Value in my racing computer.  The result is much better than I expected,. better than I would have believed.  I can run 16 cars heard in GPL, and. frame rate is better than with a SB 16 running four car sounds!  Sound. quality is much improved, and online racing is dramatically better.. . I've added links to a number of sites which offer graphical. enhancements, including complete carsets, and alternative sound samples. for GPL.. .

1	It's the way I prepared for all of my training.	. My recommendation to prospective students was to fly a couple of lessons before. starting ground school, and complete the ground study concurrently with the. flight training.  A few hours in the airplane will make it a whole lot easier. to understand some of the early portions of a ground training course, and. you'll get to see what you learn in your ground study put to use in the. airplane, which tends to make it easier to retain over the long term.. . Self study works fine.  It's the way I prepared for all of my training.  Most. of my students, though, preferred the structured classroom environment that one. of our ground schools provided.. .

I'm far from being an expert at crosswind landings, but as flippant as. it sounds, your instructor's advice to do whatever it takes is really. true.  Crosswind landings began to click for me only when I stopped. thinking about technique so much, and started simply pointing the plane. down the runway with the rudder and using the ailerons to keep it from. drifting.  Everything else is done normally.  As you know, all of this. is easier said than done, but if you're like me you'll have to learn to. overcome the tendency to try to land with the wings level.. . T.

Since aviation radios are. very expensive, it is the accepted practice to depower these items before. starting or stopping the engine.  Many training airplanes have had radio. master switches installed so you only have to turn off one switch to kill the. power to all the avionics.  If your airplane does not have a radio master,. you should use the on/off switch on each of the avionics items to turn them. off.. . 2)  I do not know of any modern VOR's that normally require a warm-up period.. Transponders do require a brief warm-up.  This is why they have a "stand-by". switch setting.  Your VOR may have a failing electrical component or a cold. solder somewhere.. . --.

I don't agree at all!  If I were in that plane, I'd worry!  If the ASI. is reading 20-30 knots fast at cruise, what's it doing when you land? . Do you want to come in with an indicated speed 20 knots higher than your. actual speed?. . An inaccurate ASI *is* a cause for concern, and I'd refuse to fly that. plane until it's fixed.. . . About the original question, 55 to 60 degree banks for S-turns sounds a. little steep, but they're not unreasonable.  I'd call a 20 knot wind. fairly strong, and if you're keeping your turns tight, you just might. need a steep bank.  If you're airspeed is Va, around 106 knots, you're. going to be travelling 126 knots downwind and 86 upwind.  Your downwind. speed is almost 50% faster than your upwind speed.  Now do those banks. sound more reasonable?  What does your instructor think?. . However, like everyone else, I'm skeptical you were going 140 knots in. level flight.  I don't have my POH with me, but wouldn't that put you in. the yellow arc?  Not where you should be for any length of time.  Make. sure the issue is resolved to your satisfaction.  And if you don't. understand the explanation you get, make them explain again.. . -- Raven.

I'd have to agree with you here, at least so far as after they have had. their CFI convince himself that you can handle a short/soft field. landing.  Part of that means checking to see what the conditions at the. grass field really are (did they mow the lawn this month and all that),. but those sorts of checks should be part of any proper training.

That depends how you define last possible moment. I would still want time. to drop flaps after making the turn. In the aircraft I was flying at the. time, best glide speed is 86 knots while the stall speed clean is 69 knots. at 45 degrees bank or 62 knots at 30 degrees bank. I cannot think that I. would be coming in at less than best glide speed with the engine out,. which still leaves quite a bit of speed in hand for any turn I would wish. to do. The stall / spin accident on approach is completely avoidable if. you watch your speeds and is very rare in the UK.. . Colin Bignell. . .

Warping is caused by either a bad DUN setup or poor performance by the. warper's ISP's internal network or connection to the Internet.  One. other factor is the lantency rate.  The higher the lantency, the more. warping will occur.  Try Ping'ing a host and see how many "time outs" or. lost packets you receive.

Mike.... . No utility required. The functionality you need is built into Windows. Just. do the following:. . 1. Select the View | Folder Options command in Explorer or any folder. window.. . 2. In the Folder Options dialog box, select the File Types tab.. . 3. Select the New Type command button. . 4. In the Add New File Type dialog, type a description in the "Description. of Type" field, like "GPL Screenshot File.". . 5. In the "Associated extension" field type "PBF".. . 6.

Select the OK command button.. . 9. Select the Close command button.. . 10. Select the Close command button.. . There you have it, in *10* *easy* steps. You've just made an association. between all files ending in .PBF and the PBF2TGA translation utility. Now. all you have to do is select one or more PBF files and hit Enter and the. translation of all the selected files is performed. The new TGA files will. be placed in the same directory as the source files, wherever they might be.. . Caution: Before you attempt to convert 100 files simultaneously and bring. your system to its knees, select just a few and see how your system handles. the number that you've selected. Windows creates an instance of pbf2tga.exe. for every file you selected, so you'll have many applications running. simultaneously. More powerful systems can handle this with greater aplomb. than less powerful systems.. . Much easier, isn't it?. . . . . .

Well, again you've made a true statement here, so perhaps it wasn't clear. that I agree with this totally. Actually, we have 5 (or maybe more). certificated pilots employed at my place of work, but only two are active. (including me). None of the others is poor, however. But they've all lost. interest for various nebulous reasons. One is a personal friend and, when. discussing the reasons for stopping, she related that she simply lost. interest in it after about 400 hours of flying. I personally am going though. a period where I'm unsure of where to go next in flying. In my case, the. constraints are, among other things, time and money. I hate to think that I'm. about to become another statistic and am working on staying in it.

One of the main complaints that I have heard from people I know who have. tried GPL and also raced cars (or karts) is that you can't "feel" it break. away on you, so you can't react as quickly.  It all is down to sound cues,. and visual acuity and reaction.  I think it helps if you have played driving. sims for a while too.  You are used to seeing that version of "reality".. . I know of one person for whom this is their first driving sim.  He is. getting faster and faster and it adjusting to GPL's on-screen physics. display very well.   He has no formal racing experience either.  Maybe GPL. _is_ a good starter sim,  because you actually get more visual feedback. regarding what the car is doing (ex, how the suspension is working, how the. car squats under acceleration, how you use the brake and throttle to affect. the car's attitude throughout the entire corner).. .

Yeah, the weather is a funny thing there.  I'm pretty close. to the airport, so the one time I was concerned about the. weather for an 8am slot, I went anyway.  . . Actually, it was fun, is a sick masocistic fashion.. . Deepak and I waited around for a while, mostly just chatting. but actually discussing some low priority things I'd wanted. to ask.  Eventually, the visibility was enough that I thought. we could go.  . . We checked the weather at Morristown (a few miles west, the. direction from which the weather was coming), and it was improved. there too.. . So I preflighted in the COLD drizzle.  Brr.  Told ground that we'd. like to taxi for a takeoff to the Northwest.  Oddly - and this. should have been a red flag, I suppose - they said "taxi to . runway 22 or 27 at your discretion.". . What, nobody else on the field?  Weird.. . So we're at the holdline for 27 telling the tower we're ready. to go.  The tower replies "you know that the visibility to the. west is about 1 mile or less, right?". . At least I'd the novel experience of a taxi down the runway, . as we went back to park the plane.. . Anyway, because I was concerned about the weather - and because. there doesn't seem to be a way to get it by phone before the. place opens - I asked here for URLs for web sites where I ca. access weather reports.  If I've ever a question, I can check. on the pages to which I was pointed, including:. . 	http://www.avnet.co.uk/tmdg/weather/. 	http://adds.awc-kc.noaa.gov/. . You can also find a phone number for the local FSS at:. . 	http://www.mivafss.jccbi.gov/tibs.htm . . This includes an automated system which reports the weather.. . There's a system in test at CDW where you can get the. weather via phone, but because it is in test nobody. wants to give out the number.  Frustrating.. .

My system is a PII333 _not_ overclocked but. running at the correct speed and after substantial testing with my VOODOO-II. 12 megs  and my new THRILLER-3D w/ 8 megs, the Rendition runs GLP MUCHO. faster. Yes, I do have the very latest drivers for both cards as well as. WIN98. I'm talking about a difference as much as 5-10 FPS!. . I simply went to each track with all graphics options set to the max, 19 AI. cars, detail bias set to 50% and started a race at the back of the grid. At. each and every track the Rendition proved to be faster.. . Just remember, this is on my system so it does'n mean SQUAT on your PC!. . Sal V.. . .

The pricing model is such that retail stores make almost no money on add-. on packs.  Since their shelves are perpetually full they won't allow . anything to take up space that has little chance of making them money.. . That's why you're seeing so many "new" games that are minor rehashes of . existing games.  As recently as a few years ago, Ubi Soft probably would . have released MGPRS2 as an add-on.  Giving them the benefit of the doubt, . they were apparently caught off guard by how quickly add-ons were . squeezed off the shelves.  With better planning, they could have released . a sim in a different area of racing (CART, Touring car, GPL competitor, . etc.). . The game companies can't afford to rewrite their engine for every game.  . And gamers aren't willing to wait 18-24 months between releases.  So game . companies have to plan for at least two games from a given engine.. . Mighty.

Before we started having the problem, the gauge. would point straight up to the N (normal).

The last time it happened, the motor died as my wife was pulling over to the. side of the road and would not start for a few minutes.  When it did, the. gauge immediately went into the red.

1	Surprisingly accurate, quick, and easy.	Morris,. . This thread started with Loren saying that his Jepp Avstar had died.   Well,. that just happens to be the computer that I use, and I hope to God I never. have to use the aluminum E6B again.. . For those of you that say it's fast, easy, etc.  Fine.  I'm sure it is for. you.  Do you still use slide rules instead of scientific calculator's as. well?  Why not?  They worked fine too.  Fast (for those that knew how to use. them), easy (for those that knew how to use them), etc.. . My Avstar fits in my shirt pocket, I can run it with one hand while holding. it in the same hand, and is also fast, easy, etc.  It is also easier than. the aluminum version to solve wind triangle questions.  T-S-D problems are a. wash.  Problem is, they don't make the thing anymore.  All the rest are. bigger, with more "features", and IMHO more difficult to operate.  So. someday I'll be faced with the same dilemma that Loren is in.  And I don't. look forward to it.  Do I need 3 decimal point precision for this stuff?. No.  But I can round in my head.. . Unfortunately Loren, I haven't used either Sporty's or Jep's so I can't help. you on your choice.  I'm still using the same one you've grown to know and. love.. .

0	The
vocal few will crucify you and your sales will be stillborn.	  OK John,. I was kinda snide about my first reply.  But here is what you asked for.. Most of this is on the technical side.  content choice and features. are developer design choices I guess.  But here are some important. items.. .   1.  Get the Controller issue nailed down.  Thrustmaster dang near. invented the PC wheel market, but most of their older wheels are not. 100% Win95/98 friendly.   also TEST TEST TEST as many different. wheels as possible.  Force Feedback etc.   This comes from. knowing your target audience.  You have 3 kinds I would think.   The Avg. computer user who barely knows how to turn it on, he probably has a gamepad. that came with the system.  Thats ok.   I would think the next level would. be the. semi serious users.   These are folks with some sort of wheel and a pretty. good knowledge on how to set them up.  The last group would be the ultra. serious users who spend thousands on wheels, soundcards, video cards etc..    The single biggest mistake you can make is to shoot for the lowest common. denominator,  can put out "deer hunter" style mass market driving product,. but even. if you sell tons of them initially, your word of mouth reputation will be so. poor that any. other attempts at the genre will almost certainly be doomed..   2.  The 2nd biggie is Don't promote and promise things the sim can't. deliver.  EA Sports. has a very bad reputation around here from the marketing of Nascar. Revolution.    If EA Sports. put out something that made GPL seem like a kids toy...they STILL wouldn't. get any respect.. kinda goes back to the first point.  If you do go low...say so..don't tell. folks your reaching for. the stars with a sim and then sell something that barely clears the weeds.. 3.  For a sim to suceed is DOES NOT need multiplayer.  However...for a sim. to be well. recieved and to have repeat sales of a product line and good word of mouth. it MUST have. multiplayer capibilities.  The bar here is getting higher and higher.  If. you try and sell a product. that allows jerky head to head play without at least  the ability to add. many users...you are in. trouble.  Once again GPL sets a technical standard.   Even 8 player. capabilty would be acceptable. if DONE RIGHT.. 4.  You do not have to ape every feature of physics that GPL has.  Creating. a sim that is "fun" while. also believable does not mean it absolutely must be on par with GPL.    Look. at new titles like. Toca 2 and SCGT.  Certainly not the struggle to drive as GPL is but fairly. well received.. 5.  Notice I haven't compared anything to products like Need For Speed.. Once again, you. asked about a "simulation,"  If you really want to produce a Sim, strive for. that...NFS is great. fun but it most certainly is NOT a sim.    This ties in with the above, if. you want a NFS feel or. style, then you'd better let folks know early that ARCADE is the target, not. SIMULATION.  The. vocal few will crucify you and your sales will be stillborn.. 5.  More hardware.  Video cards are rapidly advancing, so are soundcards.. Provide the resouces. to your developers so that the product is not only near the cutting edge,. but COMPATIBLE with. many different formats.  There are several key boards to shoot for....The. Nvidia line AND the 3dfx. line should be considered, and made rock solid BEFORE the product is. shipped.  3d sound. and the like are a rapidly growing area..get your Vortex2 and EAX issues. found, fixed and delivered. BEFORE you give a shipping greenlight..   Any more questions?  :). dave henrie.

	. . Dale wrote:. . > Maybe.  The only time I've seem my prop stop was after the engine quit...I. . Kind of different scenario but interesting occurance...  I once had the engine quit. and prop stop during a right hand spin in a citabria (stall at 55). The rotation of. the aircraft in the same direction as the engine caused the rpm to drop enough that. the engine quit. As this particular citabria had no electric starter, we had to put. it into a dive to get the prop windmilling again and engine started. The prop. _would not_ start windmilling until we had reached 150mph (10 mph short of Vne) as. soon as it began to turn, the engine caught (say prayers of thanks!!) but we burned. up a few thousand feet of altitude in the process.

When I customize the keyboard controls to. suit myself they work properly for the session, but revert back to the. default  settings next time I use the program. Some of the main default. settings are the opposite to those in FS95. For example, to turn right I. need to press shift + Num 6, and to look right I only need to press Num 6.. In the Customize Controls panel, when I change the settings to the way I. want them it, I press Num 6 to assign the right turn but Shift + 6 appears. in the panel, and then when I am flying I only need to press the Num 6 key. to turn right.

That is always a good question, and of course the aircraft that. is "established on final" has the right of way.  Of course, he. may well be "dead right."  The primary reason for establishing. a standard traffic pattern at an uncontrolled field is to make. it easier for EVERYONE to see and find the traffic, which may. or may NOT be able to announce or hear announcements made on the. radio to the CTAF frequency.  However, it only works when everyone. uses it.  . . All I can say is please use a standard pattern at an uncontrolled. field.  I may be the fellow out there with no electrical system. who was unable to see you sneaking up on my blind spot.. . HF. 
1	I'm a student close to my checkride learning at a Class C airport (Oakland)
in very busy airspace (San Francisco Bay Area).	I think it's much more important to plan your workload properly on XCs,. because everything goes out of the window when you're too busy to keep that. heading or time that checkpoint.. . I'm a student close to my checkride learning at a Class C airport (Oakland). in very busy airspace (San Francisco Bay Area).  I'm as anal as the next. student pilot with my flight planning and cockpit organization, but I'm. most careful about organizing my workload because it's my biggest problem:. I stop following procedures/checklists/flight-plans and start reacting. instead of acting when I'm distracted or too busy.. . A prime distraction for me is ATC, especially because I usually don't. factor it into my planning.  On the first few minutes of a X-C, I typically. talk to ATIS, Ground, Tower, Departure, Radio and Center.  Along the way, I. might dial in Flight Watch or various ASOSs, not to mention the half-dozen. VORs in my flight-plan.  If Bay Departure asks me to switch to Travis. Approach or calls traffic when I'm trying to compute my groundspeed, of. course I'm going to drop the E-6B and do the "Aviate, Navigate, Communicate". thing.  By the time I've settled down again, I've lost a few precious. minutes and probably wandered off course or am almost on top of my next. checkpoint.  The only thing that helps is to fly the X-C in my armchair. first and anticipate the ATC hand-offs along the way.. . Another thing that increases my workload is checkpoints that are too close. to each other.  I know some CFIs like to see checkpoints every 10nm, but. even with no ATC chatter these come up too fast for me (even in a C150 it. takes only 6-7 minutes to do 10nm).  I've found that checkpoints every 20. nm or so apart work best for me if I'm primarily using VORs for navigation.. The last checkpoint before my destination usually falls by the wayside as. I'm too busy talking to ATC or scanning for traffic or going through my. descent/pre-landing checklists to bother with the flight plan.. . So do yourself a favour and plan to give yourself enough time.  The more. frazzled you are, the less you'll enjoy your X-C.. -- . Rao Akella   <rao@tcsi.com>.

0	I haven't drove it or tried to start it since.	1974 Alfa Romeo Spider. . I bought this car a few years ago to restore but have no time with all else.. It is the Veloce.. It has the SPICA fuel injection, a hard top. and a spare set of wheels. The. body is in fair condition with mostly surface rust and no apparent. accidents.. The boy I bought this from was driving it a few weeks before I bought it,. then it quit. Rather than fix the mechanical end first, he put a new. interior in it. A little backwards, but I came out ahead. The interior is. red and looks pretty decent.. I hauled the car home, spent a few hours on it and discovered the tail pipe. hanger bracket had broken, letting the tailpipe fall down onto the fuel line. cutting off the fuel supply. I temporary hung it up and drove it around the. block. That was three and a half years ago.. I haven't drove it or tried to start it since. I feel confident the motor. should be pulled and gone through, though  I would expect to find few. problems with it.. If you are interested, the car is in south central Kentucky.

want to fly commuters but it is virtually impossible to get into a major

Why did you wait so long to start flying? Usually people that want to fly. for the airlines come out of there mothers with wings, applets and big time. motivation (like I did). If you just enjoy flying, maybe get some additional. ratings, etc.. and work as a CFI in your part time, but that can't really. pay the bills.. .

Mr. Dewey's column is very informative with research . links to. the medical studies from Harvard and other leading researchers.  These . oils are. in our foods.  Even the American Heart Association has recently issued a. warning to avoid hydrogenated oils.  You must read this to save yourself . and. others and possibly heal yourself.  Denmark is the only country that bans . these. oils since 1950, and they have the lowest deaths rates from any of these. diseases.  Mr. Dewey's site is http://www.dldewey.com.   I urge you to . read. this, it will save your life.  And no, this is not one of these new . things that. this or that causes cancer.  This is for real folks and the FDA has kept . this. truth from us.  I am a member of the League of Women's Voters and I . understand. they have refused to get this information our to our members.

I. don't remember what state you live in, but here in Florida impersonating a. law enforcement officer (which would fit the definition of FAA employees. authorized to pursue enforcement actions) is a felony.  I'll bet dollars to. donughts that there are Federal criminal statutes that you may have violated. as well.  I offer this unsolicited advice....you are walking on very, very,. very thin ice if you behave in this manner.    If the individual you acosted. had asked for your credentials (I don't think he would have been fooled by a. temporary PP certificate) he would have been 100% within his rights to call. your bluff, call 911, and demand your arrest.  Frankly, I would have done. exactly that.. To say that we are all a member of the FAA is ridiculous.  It would never. stand up in any court.  Think logically about it....I have a driver's. license issued by the Florida Department of Highway Safety but that hardly. makes me a state trooper, does it?  I also have a passport issued by the US. State Department but that hardly makes me Madeline Albright or an employee. of the US State Department.  If an FAA enforcement staffer read your email. (a very possible occurence) you have in essence confessed publically to what. could well be a criminal offense.  Remember Jack Kevorkian and his. videotape!. If you really think the situation warrants it, get the pilot's N number and. name (if possible) and report the details to the local FSDO.  But don't play. policeman yourself!. Finally, to change the subject slightly, what is the active runway at an. uncontrolled field?  ALL OF THEM!   For example, yesterday the wind here was. light and variable.  Airplanes were taking off and landing from 21, 27, 15,. and 9 all more or less at the same time.    Unnerving?  A bit, yes.  Should. one runway have been chosen and used by everyone?  Arguably, yes.  Was what. was happenning legal?  Absolutely.. Regards,. Tom. CP-ASEL (PP Glider). .

AFAIK, most aircraft will have the nosewheel deflected in this . situation.

Yes, this is what I have noticed.  The deflection causes a slight . downwind swerve as the nosewheel touches, but it's not a big deal, . because you are steering "by eye", and will naturally correct this the . moment it occurs - like hitting a pothole or something in a car.  There . is no need to think a lot about it, you'll just automatically compensate . for the small swerve - and IME it is indeed small - nothing to worry . about in advance.. . In a X-wind, once the nosewheel contacts, applying a little less . up-elevator to keep it firmly on the ground is IMHO a good thing.  . Holding the stick back in a strong & gusty X-wind during the high-speed . part of the rollout after landing can make the nosewheel very "light", . and steering alternates between rudder and nosewheel for a while, which . I suspect causes more tyre-wear than holding it on the ground will.  . Check with your instructor though.. . During a X-wind approach, be careful that you are not too tense on the . rudder, and your feet are in the correct position on the pedals.  I've . been told that pilots have inadvertently applied the brakes on occasion!. . All the above is just my experience, not an official view, but maybe an . instructor will correct/agree/amplify later.. . ==========. Dave Mould. Not a QFI. ==========. . .

A common. configuration is: T/O and cruise with zero flaps up to about. 65 knots (best L/D occurs in this flap position), negative. one position for cruise from 65 to 80 knots (about -5. degrees) and negative 2 (perhaps about -10 degreees) for. cruise above that.

0	(I would never had even considered the warez version, if it had not
been for the fuss it created in this newsgroup, so blame yourselves!).	Here are my observations of the differences between the beta, (v0.2.0.0), and. the final version (v1.0.0.0),  of GPL, some of which I understand, and some of. which I dont.. . Okay, okay, first of all, yes I downloaded the early Warez version, while I. waited for the final version to appear here in the UK. I am not defending this. course of action, but now that Ive spent my £34.99 in Dixons, and deleted the. old version, my conscious is clear...!! (flame away lame burgers..........). . Let me tell you about the system Im using currently. I have a P200 pentium,. (actually a P133 with an overdrive chip), 4 meg video card and a 12 meg voodoo. 2, and the frame rate is pretty poor at about 13-15 fps. I believe this to be. due in part to the inferior FPU, included in the overdrive chip from Evergreen,. believe me, Ive read every post about improving fps in r.a.s over the last few. weeks., and tried every tweak, and still no improvement. Not to worry, Im. investing in 450mhz PII in the next few weeks, so Ill soon be running at 36. fps, (you know it makes sense..!) I also have a Thrustmaster NASCAR Pro wheel. and peddles, and even though the TM gets plenty of bad press in r.a.s., Im not. a heavy user, and it seems to suit me fine, (I can feel the flames starting. already...). . Anyway regardless of the fps, I still find the game very playable, if a little. difficult to control. With the demo, and before any major tweaking, I was only. getting 10 fps on a good day, which made the Lotus at the Glen almost. impossible to control. At this point I decided to look for the warez version,. to see if there was any way I could make the game more playable by adjusting. the setups. (I would never had even considered the warez version, if it had not. been for the fuss it created in this newsgroup, so blame yourselves!). . . Having found the beta version, (v0.2.0.0.), I proceeded to swap the Lotus for. the Ferrari, and spend my life at Monza, Spa and the Ring. After gradually. switching off more and more detail, (only the groove, horizon, wall textures. switched on, plus trees at Monza, you cant run at monza without the trees for. god sake), I finally arrived at my 12-15 fps average.(If you switch everything. off, not only does it only increase the fps by about 10%, or in my case 1 fps,. but it makes the game look strangely like Indy 500, and a bit like GP2!!). . Any after many many laps at the Ring, my best lap was still only 11:48.68,. which although nowhere near the 8:17 I was reading about at in r.a.s., I still. felt was pretty good considering the technical restrictions of my system. I. moved back to Monza, where after maybe 200 laps, I could still only just. scratch the edge of 1:37, even after going round the dial on setups. Even. though I was hopelessly un competitive, I just love throwing the Ferrari into. the Curva Grande, and struggling to fly through Ascari on full power. I also. spent an enormous amount of time at Spa, finally managing to nail down a 4:04. lap. I then setup a race, so that I could watch where Bandini and Amon were. changing gears and braking, and you could just imagine my horror to see Graham. Hill set a fastest lap of 3:30 after only the first lap..!!, 34 seconds faster. than I had been. This was a low point in my GPL career.. . As I could not download any setups in the beta, and I did not have the great. "Four-Wheel-Drift" manual by Steve Smith, I was not sure whether it was my. skill level, my setups, the low fps, the TM wheel, or a combination of all of. these that was making me so much slower that everyone else in the world. Still,. I continued lapping at various circuits ands loving every minute of it.. . Last Sunday I managed to pick up my copy of the final version of this great. game, and could not get back home quick enough. After installing, and spending. a great deal of time reading the "FWD" manual, I set up my wheel and peddles,. put on my driving socks, started my engine and headed straight to Monza, the. circuit I felt that I knew best. . . The first thing I noticed was that my average fps had dropped to a consistent. 12-13fps, with very little variation. This was quite noticeable when doing the. first few recon laps, as the game played a little jumpy, but perseverance is my. middle name and I continued for about 10 or so laps, before coming into the. pits to look at my setup. Imagine my surprise when I check my lap times to find. I had gone over 2 secs quicker on my 7th lap at Monza, than I had gone in the. previous 3 weeks with the beta..!!! Even though I did not feel that I was. driving as smoothly or fast, I seemed to have improved dramatically. Off to Spa. next, and the same again, within 2 laps I was 6 secs faster, even though I felt. more ragged!. . I believe that the main reason for the improvement was down to the default car. having a much more competitive setup than either the demo or the beta version.. Well at least now I know that my previous attempts to set the car up had been. hopelessly wrong, and now that I had the "FDW" manual, I should be able to. tweak my setup to be better.. . I then downloaded the Doug Amarno set ups from Alison Hines, "Eagle Woman". site, and gave them a try. Both the Monza and Spa setups seemed to be very. skittish, and proved very squirrily under braking. Being a purist, Im not keen. on using other peoples setups, (sort of like cheating I think), and I like to. set cars up to suit my style of driving, (stiff, low and controllable). . . So last night I returned to Spa, (what a track..!!), armed with the default. Ferrari setup and the manual, and set about setting the car up to my liking.. After many return trips to the pits, and some spectacular crashes into several. of the buildings along the back straight, I set the damage to realistic, and. went out for a full blown training session, in an attempt to bring my lap times. down. On lap 17, after an almost incident free lap of shortshifting and five. sixths power,  I managed a 3:45.38, which represents a massive 19 secs faster. that my previous best. I then watched Dougs 3:25 lap of Spa in the Lotus, and. saw several areas where I could improve my braking and gear changing, but by. this time it was midnight, and I did not want to annoy my wife any further than. I needed to.. . Even though Im still significantly slower that the top AI drivers, I feel that. I know where the improvements to my setups and driving strategy can be made.. And when I get my P2 450, and 36fps, I believe that this will only help my. times.. . Another change I have noticed is that the linearity slider seems to be much. more sensitive. When using the beta, I was setting the linearity under the "a". of linear, which is where I set it when I first installed the final version.. This made the car impossible to drive, where only the slightest movement of the. wheel sends the car from one side of the track to the other, and made braking a. life and death decision. I have now set the linearity to about the middle of. the scale, which seems about right for the moment. Has anyone else noticed. this, or is it just me?, (unique or freak?). I will try moving closer to the. left hand end, once I get a little more competitive.. . I also noticed that the TV1 & TV2 camera angles have changed from the beta to. the final, certainly at Spa, which I think is an improvement.. . I really enjoy the driving experience of GPL, and even though not having the. fastest system in the known universe, with a little perseverance and. dedication, I am extracting as much enjoyment from the sim, more than equal to. the effort I am putting in to it. GPL is certainly the most realistic sim Ive. driven, (I was a heavy user of GP2, as a GP2 league driver), and Papy should be. congratulated on their major achievement.. . Watch out my fellow GPL drivers, Im hoping to lock wheels with you very soon,. on a circuit somewhere....... . SteveG. . . . . .

	When we tried a LAN game earlier, we got the pole sitter to raise his arm.. When "Press F1 for help" appeared on his PC, he dropped his arm and then the. race started.. . Not only does this give you enough time to avoid being black flagged, but it. also prevents the starter from getting an unfair advantage, as he can't. change into 1st gear until his arm is down!. . The only problem we found with this is that anyone else on the front row may. have to either switch to chase view, or look left / right to see the. starters arm. Also in a big race (3 or 4 rows) cars behind may not be able. to see, (but this should aid clean starts, as people further back wouldn't. jump the start!). Seemed to work ok though, and avoids problems with the time delay in chat. that you may have typing a "go" message.. . Just an idea!. . Mike West.. . 3DNow UK! : www.3dnow.freeserve.co.uk. . . P.S.

OK - this may be accurate, although only if the trim is LE trim (don't know the .

0	Anyway, I'd hang onto the 28.8 modem and get the 56k modem from a vendor
who will allow you to return it if necessary.	I agree with this, although some 56k modems can be forced to run using. the v.34 protocol, and thus perhaps avoid the retries which happen on. bad phone lines at the higher speeds.  . . Also, 28.8 is perfectly adequate for joining races in GPL, even those. with fairly large fields (ie over a dozen).  The only advantage in GPL. with anything faster is in being able to host perhaps one more player.. In GPL, the upload speed is the determining factor for the number of. players you can host, and since the max upload speed for a 56k modem is. 33.6, there's not a huge advantage there for GPL.. . However, using a USB modem (which implies 56k, since that's the only. speed of USB modem being made, AFAIK) can be a big advantage.  See my. related post in this thread.. . Anyway, I'd hang onto the 28.8 modem and get the 56k modem from a vendor. who will allow you to return it if necessary.  Strongly consider a USB. modem if you've got Win98 and a USB port.. .

I'm really going out on a limb here, since I don't know the extent of. the "bounce" that you are seeing, but one possibility is that you are. flying too fast for the aircraft you are using.  I've seen this. frequently since I switched from FS5.1 CD to FS98.  In 5.1, when I. exceeded the aircraft's safe speed, all I got was an "overspeed". warning.  In FS98, when I reach the built in "speed limit", the. aircraft starts jumping all over the sky, quickly becomes. uncontrollable, and finally crashes due to "overstress".  I've got a. BAE 146-200 that would do over 400 knots in FS5.1 with no problems,. but in FS98, the converted 146-200 won't do over 250 knots without. coming apart in the air.  *Very* annoying!  Hope this helps.. . Jim.

think it was called.	Ther was a fun game about 8 years ago that had Phillip Island. Motorcycle Gp I. think it was called. You could race 125, 250 or 500cc. Team Suzuki also brough out. a game around the same time but I could never control the thing.. . Since we have ahouse on Phillip Island and I attend just about every race meeting. there it was interesting to see how the graphics compared to the real thing. The. Hayshed is there an the pit lane looks pretty accurate. The only part of the track. not true to form is Siberia. Since this is where I spend many a cold day watching. bikes I feel a bit upset that the game shows no crowd here at all. Just trees that. don't exist. I assume this is so they don;t have to model Bass Straight.. .

1	This color must be pure black, i.e., Red=0, Blue=0, and Green=0.	     The "grey outside" problem is a result of the panel designer using the. wrong color for the transparet portion of the bitmap.  The transparency. color is determined by the left uppermost 4-pixel square of the bitmap. image.  This color must be pure black, i.e., Red=0, Blue=0, and Green=0.. Fortunately, it's easy to fix the panels with the gray problem.  All you. need to do is open the bitmap file in MS Paint and draw a pure black. two-pixel-wide line down the entire leftside of the panel (theoretically. this should only have to be done for the upper left 4-pixel square but some. panels seem to need two pixels all the way down).. . ---------. .

At this URL : http://www.sim-racing.com/   If you check out the Icr2. section, there's a track called BullRun2000.  It's because after the Y2K. they decided to put less banking into the last corner and the 180 U-turn. after the backstretch.  It's really incredible for Icr2.  It has optimized. AI, and completely made *.3d0 and *.trk files. You will easily see that it's. a great track for racing, and you don't fear to loose it into those banked. corners (It's just that Icr2 somehow has "limits" to their physic engine).. The AI was made by "moi" ;-)  (they are incredible at 100%, with 2wide on. the straight and drafting effects).. . I would suggest to any fan of BullRun in Icr2 to get this track.

	Maybe a stupid question, but is it possible to do a quick lap without the. sliding sound in every corner?. It´s like driving in GPL (not really,but almost).. I have just had this game a few days so maybe it is me how are bad.. I can drive Silverstone in 1 27 but then it´s a terrible sliding through. many curves.. . . 
1	May be a clue.	Hey Jude,. . My goodness, that used to be a folk song long ago.  Anyway, if you'rre turning. onto a right crosswind after takeoff I think it's fair to say that is with a. righthand banked turn that is probably combined with a climb. . . Normally, in a properly rigged airplane, with a propeller that rotates to the. right when viewed from the cockpit, you'd have to apply a little RIGHT RUDDER. to compensate for the YAW FORCES being exerted on the airplane:  Spiraling. slipstream and p-factor.  TORQUE is a ROLL FORCE exerted on the airplane by the. engine.  The emphasis is so you'll recall the associations.. . Either you are flying an airplane that is quite out of rig, or one whose. propeller rotates opposite the way it normally should, or the TSI is a bit out. of whack position/mounting, or you're holding some left aileron in for some. reason.  The left aileron application would mean that the right wing's aileron. is down to some degree.  The DOWN aileron would then PRODUCE AILERON DRAG, also. known as ADVERSE YAW (the result acutally).  The drag of that aileron would. want to yaw the airplane to the right. That would be reflected by a left. displacement of the inclinometer's ball (part of the TSI) to the left.  And. that would require you to apply the left rudder.  What you may be dois. sub-consiously cross-controlling the airplane for some reason. Ask your CFI to. check you one that.. . Getting back to the possibility of mis-rigging, there are a number of. non-mechanical ways to check that out.  One is hands off cruise flight, trimmed. for a constant altitude, another is a full power off stall that's entered into. with wing's level.  Watch how it rolls when the stalls occurs.  May be a clue. . You could also check it in a power off glide (don't forget to clear the. engine!)  I"d ask your CFI to do these "tests" if I were you.. . Other than the above, I cannot think of another reason the problem exists.  Do. you have to put left rudder in during a lefthand banked climbing turn?  If so,. that could be a hint about the rigging.. . Good luck, hope I gave you a few good ideas.  Bye!  .

The. oil leak was due to a bad seal or gasket, and no oil I know of attacks either. . It is possible you had a bad seal/gasket, but the problem was covered up by. sludge/varnish.

Im not sure but I suppose there are probably several, but after awhile you'll. get the feel of doing your flight plans and you won't realy need it.  I just. look at the horsepower of the plane Im getting in(Fuel Consumption) I know the. cruise speed of most planes I get in, (Time) Distance is an easy one, just. rember Mile a Minute. One minute of latitude = 1 nautcal mile.  Those. horizontile lines on a sectional are 30' apart I believe so the distance. between the two is 30nm.  So now you can use 2 fingers and get your approximate. distance of the trip. Now leaving your self a good saftey margin for diverting. for weather and you can see whereyou need to stop for fuel.  I always try to. plan my landings so I have 1/4 tanks left.  If I run into stronger than. predicted headwinds and see an airport below or ahead and I'm 1/4 on 1 tank and. less than 1/2 on the other I land and get fuel,  only lose a few minutes.. You'll get the hang of it..

1	I really didn't know what to do.	Yes , I admit it. I was so scared of landings, andbefore round up and flare. I got a brain lock. I really didn't know what to do.. It will just click in your head .... like most of the things ... and. remember more frustration you will have, more satisfactory will be the time. when you'll find out you can do it.. After my horrible frustration, one day I went to fly and something just. clicked in my head and I screamed : " I'M GONNA LAND THIS FUCKING AIRPLANE".. My CFI just laughed, took hands off the controls and I did it.. Sorry fir F-word, but I really screamed that.. From that time I have no major problem with landings ..... . It really needs PATIENCE. I don't know, It really didn't seem to be coming. with my effort orsomething. The best description is :. It's just happened to me .. . Good luck and be sure we all know that damn frustration feeling.

The worst that. can happen is games that use the stencil buffer will have poorer shadows on the. V2 and those that don't split up their 512K textures will appear as blurrier. models.. . > Voodoo 3 is not as feature full as the competition.. . Certainly, can't be argued (unless you consider "speed" an important feature.. :).  The entire reason these threads go on so long is because people are arguing. about the degree of relevance for these features in today's market.  I seem to. recall the same arguments happening with AGP 2X - boy, that took the world by. storm!  A "critical" feature at the time that went completely unused due to it. being eclipsed by the memory architecture on the boards themselves - when you're. pushing 3.2 gigs a sec on the card, going back down to 350megs/sec is utterly. crippling to performance.  I see somewhat the same situation with AGP4X - not to. mention you'll need a new motherboard and ram to accommodate the extra. bandwidth.. . >And, you find a way to. > discount the facts.. . He discounts their relevancy in today's market.  There are no games that use. 512K textures.  There are no games that require AGP texturing.  Quake3 will be. one of the first games that might show the advantages of larger textures and a. stencil buffer.  We'll see how many follow in its wake, and what performance. penalty these features might entail.  It's always a trade-off with every card.. Either poor drivers, slower speed, poorer image quality, less game support,. higher price, or the card isn't available.. . .

1	I have
about 15 hours now and I can fly the plane.	Went up for an hour today. It was pretty windy, but it was right down the. runway so takeoffs and landings weren't too bad-well they wouldn't have been. were it not for all the chatter in my headphones. We flew to a towered. airport nearby (which I've only done once before) and I was doing the radio. calls. There was traffic in that air and all were talking. I was trying to. make radio calls announcing turns while my CFI was telling me what to say. word for word. I couldn't get a word in edgewise. I managed to make the. necessary calls after which my CFI would nitpick every little word while at. the same time the guy behind me is trying to communicate with me and the. tower was trying to communicate with me. We managed to get down and parked. without anybody running into anybody, but then when we flew back to home. base for a few TnG's, I finally had to call it quits because the CFI just. plain wouldn't be quiet. I didn't want to be rude and tell him to put a lid. on it, so I just stated firmly that this would be the last landing. I don't. know if he took the hint or what, but he was pretty much quiet for the last. landing and it was one of my best for the day.. . I have to say I was really starting to lose patience with him today. I have. about 15 hours now and I can fly the plane. If I go 40 feet over or under. altitude while I'm trying to line up on downwind he say "watch your. altitude." While I'm trying to get my altitude *perfect*, I'll crowd the. runway. He points this out so I try to get *perfectly* aligned with the. runway and my airspeed goes up, which he immediately points out. I know it's. suppose dto all happen together. I was dealing with a LOT of turbulence and. quite a bit of traffic with its accompanying radio chatter. I think what's. happening is that he's noticing things at a different  time than I am and. while I'm correcting what I've noticed he catches something and I have to. concentrate on that, etc., etc. The windsock was straight out today and. there were some real good bumps. There was a lot of traffic and I wasn't. able to make any of my radio calls because the CFI was talking or somebody. else was making calls. Even though his hands aren't on the controls, he's. got to verbally correct every little move of the controls I make. I think if. we had worked on landings earlier in my training, I would have been soloing. already, but I'm in no real rush. I know he's getting close to being ready. to solo me since he's got me signing rental agreements and carrying my. logbook, etc., and I don't want to switch CFI's at this point. As sloppy as. my landings were today, he might be changing his mind about now.. . Question #1) Is it ok to tell your CFI that you would like quiet in the. cockpit while you're landing? I know he has mountains more experience than. me, but I think at this point he should be observing what I do and seeing. how I evaluate and react to different conditions and circumstances. Instead,. I think he's still trying to control the plane verbally through me, which is. tantamount to flying it himself. IE., I don't get a lot out of it.. . Question #2) When I am down near the runway and bleeding off airspeed, I use. little back and forth elevator control inputs in order to judge wether or. not I'm going slow enough to flare. When the plane stops tending to go up. when I pull back, and the contro; movements need to become larger and. larger, I start adding steady back pressure until I settle to the runway. My. CFI keeps telling me to "hold the controls in the landing attitude." This is. fine on an ideal approach in smooth/no wind with everything set to land, but. I can't get it to work when dealing with high winds and turbulence. I had a. couple of real hard landings trying to just "hold the controls" because I. was sinking too fast and wanted to pull back some more, but didn't. What are. some opinions as to bleeding off airspeed near the runway?. . . --. Mike Regish. http://members.tripod.com/~mike534. . .

Most people get a new racing game/sim and jump straight in with both . feet and immediately try to break all known lap records at the first . attempt without even glancing at the manual!!!!. . This usually results in lots of unscheduled *off-road* driving . admiring the scenery when you should in fact be on the track . practicing. This is caused because the drivers have not learnt how to . control the car, not learnt the circuits, and they are driving *TOO . FAST* and end up continually crashing. This in turn dents confidence, . and can get very annoying? and you do not learn that much from . continually crashing (apart from where the barriers are situated? . and how slow it is to get out of the gravel trap?). . The more conservative approach (driving slower and gradually building . up speed) will ultimately be more beneficial (IMHO?) because of many . reasons.... . 1) Driving slower gives you more time to react.. 2) You can see & learn the correct racing line easier at lower . speeds.. 3) Car control is easier at lower speeds.. 4) You will crash less at lower speeds.. 5) If you crash less your confidence will rise.. 6) Remembering circuits is easier at lower speeds.. . My method for a new game/sim is to take a few laps to just drive . around the circuit, not fast at all, to familiarise myself with the . general layout. (Also check out any maps or diagrams in the manual, . etc).. . Then try some faster laps, but the object is to just try and stay on . the track without spinning/crashing off. Once I can do this . consistently (I have learnt to anticipate the corners and bends) I . start to gradually increase speed and try to lower my laptimes, but . the emphasis is on gradually.. . As you gradually drive more laps, you get more familiar with the . circuit, and can anticipate better, try to go faster on the straights . on each lap by accelerating out of corners earlier. also try to brake . into corners a little bit later on each lap. Each lap you are only . trying to improve on the last one (even if it is only by 1/100th of a . second) and not trying for an out and out record. Although, . obviously, if you drive an outstanding lap, then that is a bonus!. . As the laps count off, you will find the best braking points, the . best gear change points, and the correct line for the circuit. You . will also be learning about the car, how it brakes, how it . accelerates, how it slides, how the wheels lock up, etc. Because you . are doing it gradually, you are learning that little bit extra on . each lap, feeling for the limit of the car, the braking limits, the . traction limits, etc.. . I find using this method, after about 20 - 25 laps of pretty much any . circuit, in any game/sim, that I have learnt enough about the car and . circuit to drive a fairly competitive lap? This means after say about . half an hour to an hour I can be pretty quick and fairly consistent.. . Whereas, the guy that just jumps in feet first and drives hell for . leather (unless he is *very* talented?) ends up spending the first . half an hour to an hour spinning all over the place, crashing out, . smashing into things, *AND* at the end of it all, he knows bugger all . about the cars limit or the layout of the circuit, cos he has spent . more time off the circuit than the marshals!!!. . 8-). . *Peter*    8-).

After touchdown, the aircraft is still in "Flying mode" (Let's call it that. to simplify things a little) which fades out slowly in about 5 seconds.. . So, for the first 3 seconds, on the ground, you are just along for the ride. until you see the NWS (Nose Wheel Steering) light come on in the HUD. While. you are waiting for NWS to come on, the Upwind wing is getting picked up by. the crosswind & you can't do anything about it.. . Once nosewheel steering comes on, you use rudders only to keep the A/C lined. up & you ignore that strange feeling of the upwind wing lifting up (Easier. to say than to actually do it BTW).. . Also, the nose of the aircraft does not turn into the wind, it turns AWAY.. You correct with very slight opposite rudder (which make the plane feel like. it's really going to flip over. but you keep ignoring that fact & don't do. anything about it. (Again, easier said than done).. . You cannot use ANY aileron at anytime after landing (And if you do, don't. move the stick more than a 16th of an inch). In flying mode, the aircraft. will understand a lateral stick deflection as a command to roll & the flight. control computers will roll you period.. . Scary eh? Still want to fly that Cool Jet?   Probably!  :-). . End of story.... . BTW I did exactly as I was trained to do after landing & I it's still scary. no matter what... I don't know if you ever get used to it.. . Cheers!. . -Pat. . Feel free to ask questions. I'll try to answer them the best I can (With my. limited F-18 knowledge). . .

Part of it is cost cutting by the automakers...the fewer. > colors, the less complexity and the less it cost them.. . I would think that's almost the only reason. Think about it: a car. interior contains dozens, if not hundreds, of parts, made and colored. by totally different processes. Just getting them all to match. acceptably and consistently is a major task. Not to mention multiple. inventories of replacement parts, more bins of stuff at the assembly. plant (with more chances of mistakes and parts shortages),. etc. Carmakers really don't want to go through that for a color that. only would be bought by, say, 5%-10% of customers.. . Actually, reading that paragraph above suggests that quality is. another big reason, or perhaps the cost/quality tradeoff: if everyone. would live with more color mismatches, then extra interior colors. wouldn't cost so much.. . So you find two or three colors that will harmonize reasonably with. the range of exterior colors you offer. Rest assured that the color. and trim people at each manufacturer fight for all the color they can. get, but it's just not practical for mass-market cars.. . > On Wed, 25 Nov 1998 21:19:23 -0400, Greg Beaulieu. > <ab348@chebucto.ns.ca> wrote:. . <snip>. . > >Man, I miss the days when you could order these, or green, or gold, with a. > >bit of zip inside rather than this anonymous-looking stuff they all seem. > >to be using now.. . -- . -Stephen H.

Good point; I actually thought about saying this as I was posting. but decided it would make it too complicated.  . . Springfield, MO is the same way; it is Class D airspace, but. functionally it must be treated as Class C (sort of like a TRSA?).  . The clue is, there's an approach control frequency on the VFR charts,. with the notation to "Contact Springfield Approach within 20 miles". (just like Class C); arriving VFR flights get a squawk code.. . There's also a listing for SPRINGFIELD approach/dep control in . the AF/D.. . I don't have a ND AF/D, but I bet Fargo also has its own. Approach/Departure control service.. . I'm not certain, but this seems to be a way of providing radar. separation services at busy airports which aren't quite busy enough to. qualify as Class C.  Perhaps one of the controllers here will comment?. . Maybe we can make up a rule, in the spirit of "I before E" for spelling?. "Contact ground at Class D, Except when Like C"?. . .

Aeronautical. charts are very accurate with respect to locations of airports and. navaids, but are not very accurate all with respect to ground terrain.. Major features are often represented in the dead-wrong place.

With ASD you need USGS or comparable data, or you can draw things in. manually.  I have had to do this in many parts of the world, where. there is not published "data".  For this I use NOAA oceanographic. charts and a very good world atlas.  To make it worthwhile to import a. background bitmap for tracing, you would really need to superimpose. images from 2-3 sources.  I think its just easier to put the chart(s). up on a stand and just start drawing.. . >Third Question: Does the Abacus programme allow you to set the distance. >at which objects "appear" as their full size/shape.

You can select the Area Range (distance the building is loaded. into memory) and the visible range on all of the ASD buildings,. hangars, etc.  Macro objects from other sources (like mine) may be set. for closer ranges, with use within the airport grounds in mind.  But a. basic knowledge of SCASM will allow you to change these.. . The new version of ASD, which is in the works now, will include. 400-500 macros that I made, which will also allow you to select all of. those visibility parameters just like the other objects.. . .

My. > question is: Am I too concerned because wake turbulence is first and. > foremost associated with really heavy aircraft? Or is this the typical. > example of how ATC will treat a small private plane at a busy airport?. . Don't feel "lesser" because you're in a small private plane; ATC. doesn't want to fill out paperwork on your accident anymore than they. do on a big one. But, they probably handle more large aircraft and are. "used to" spacing the larger aircraft. If they aren't pilots, they. might not know internally that wake turbulence is a bigger problem for. us than the big guys.. . On the other hand, they need to keep traffic flowing, so you need to. be reasonable (and not demand 10 miles in trail :-) ) Yesterday, I. accepted a 10kt crosswind to land on 17 instead of 24 because everyone. else was using 17 and trying to schedule me in on 24 was becoming a. pain for ATC. (Winds were 250@10-12 IIRC) I accepted the clearance. because I could land safely in that crosswind (even though it would be. "easier" to land right into the wind). If I had any doubts though, you. can bet that I'd have waited as long as it took to get a slot on 24.. . ---Jim.

1	That triggered my asthma and I had been using my inhaler 2 to 5 times
a day since March.	I have mild asthma. I quit smoking a little over 4 years ago and within 2. months had my first asthma attack. I think mine is triggered by stress. It's. funny that I didn't need my inhaler at all in '97 until March of this year. when I had some problems with a real psycho that I work with. (Guess. what...I work in the post office.) Well, I got screwed by my employer and. the court system as well as having gotten maced by this guy just for the fun. of it. That triggered my asthma and I had been using my inhaler 2 to 5 times. a day since March. After my first hour lesson, I used the inhaler once and. haven't used it since. I find that focussing my attention on learning to fly. has taken my mind completely off my situation at work and I haven't had even. a hint of an attack. I was worried that the stress of learning to land might. trigger it, but that's a different kind of stress that I kind of like. I. still keep my inhaler handy and I haven't gotten my medical yet, but I. really don't think it will be a problem. My worst attacks are uncomfortable,. but not debilitating. This was a big concern to me when I researched getting. my license, but everything I've read and heard from the instructors and. pilots is that it shouldn't be a problem.. . --.

Could be one of two things (it's been a while since I flew a 172) that. immediately spring to mind:If the aircraft was loaded towards an aft CG, or. perhaps if you were just light and accelerating beyond the trim speed.

call in my turn to down wind and another aircraft calls down wind.	Roger Halstead K8RI and EAA Chapter 1093 Historian. N833R World's oldest Debonair? S# CD-2. http://members.tm.net/rdhalste. . .

Is the next step to. >give a more detailed position report (altitude and location on downwind. >leg)?. . Over the years I've had this happen a number of times.  I've been ready to. call in my turn to down wind and another aircraft calls down wind. which by. the time he finished the statement I'm also down wind.  My first reaction is. to ask where are they while stating my location quickly and concisely.. I know that they are not real cose to me as I start looking over the down. wind from several miles out and also check above and below.. . Nine times out of ten the response is "I'm on down wind", which I had pretty. much figured out from the radio call.  The problem is that depending on. where they enter down wind they could be any where within an area over three. miles long by close to a mile wide, but hopefully at the proper altitude.. . I had one call cross wind and I called entering down wind and I fly a fairly. tight pattern.  Usually about a half to 3/4 mile out.  Cross wind... Was. that mid field, at the numbers, or where?  No answer. then I hear "turning. down wind".  I finally spotted him coming across the numbers in a steep turn. to parallel the runway about 300 yards out in a 172.  I anounce base and. just as I get ready to anounce turning to final he anounces base about 300. yards off the end of the runway.  By the angle in the windshield and the. spot not moving I can tell we are going to reach the same spot at the same. time which is just where he will be turning final.. . I poured on the power and made an early left turn (no where else to go) out. of the pattern where I made a 360 and then rejoined down wind.. . by the time I had landed the 172 had landed, coasted up to the gate, picked. up a passenger, and kept right on going back out to mid field, onto the. runway and departed. Note that was without a shutdown.. . He was talking but certainly not listening.. . > I was a bit worried that a turn was going to take me right. >into the other airplane. (In this case I called base, since I was. >near the end of the downwind leg by then). Should I have turned right,. >out of the pattern? Climbed? Descended?. . I think you made the correct decision as when you are both down wind and you. don't know whether the other aircraft is in front, behind, above, or below. you the best thing is to give the path to the runway a careful examination.. Bank a bit to try and see above and below to make sure you are not landing. on, or being landed on.   As to turning right out of the pattern; The other. aircraft might be to your right and would not expect you to make a right. turn.. . In a 150 I'd not think that there would be many instances where you would be. overtaking other aircraft, Certainly there are instances, but in the 172,. 182, Cherokees, Archers, and Warriors there is the posibility of over taking. a slower aircraft and being overtaken by faster ones as well.. . A number of times when the other aircraft would not respond I've resorted to. asking on Unicom, or the CTAF if anyone can spot the other aircraft and if. so where is he in ralation to me.. . The unfortunate thing is that when other aircraft anounce that they are down. wind it only means that they are (most likely) *some where* on the down wind. side of the runway and a cross wind may be from most anywhere over the field. to as much as two miles off the out going end of the runway.  Base may be. from the numbers to as much as two or three miles out.. . Idealy every one would anounce where they were, not just on down wind, base,. or final. Students have their hands ful trying to remember what to do and. when so asking for a clarification on location down wind, or where ever may. just add a bit of confusion.  Those who have been flying longer should be. capable of giving accurate position reports, particularly when requested.. Unfortunately the experienced pilots seem to be at least as guilty, or more. so than the student when it comes to accurate and timely position reports.. >.

The inherent. risk (on apparently every approach to the runway) associated. with turning off the carb heat, is NOT justified by the very rare. occasions of having to "go-around" from a well planned approach. to landing.. . Stefan,  I'm sure your instructors have preached and preached. about "staying ahead of the airplane" as this is an important. technique to safe flying practices.  It is JUST as important that. you understand that to be "too far ahead" in your actions and. thinking, can be just as risky or unsafe.. . Look at your actions the from the viewpoint of "risk" or "error. management" and reconsider how you use the carb heat.  Keep. in mind how much time, effort, etc. is required to apply the carb. heat and shove the throttle forward in the very rare event you. actually have to go-around (very little effort & delay) and weigh. that against the inherent risk(s) you're currently subjecting. yourself to on EVERY appoach to landing by turning it off.. . . --.

Once your rear end has passed the point of no return, as far as catching. it by steering into the skid, there is a place where steering the other. way really hard will let the front wheels open up enough that the front. end can roll back under the skid. This can be done in real cars in the. mud or wet, or on a dirt oval.

Well so how about this one then, you make an additional mode, call it. arcade, with the appropriate driving model for such, reducing the the. number of physichs parameters that the game relates to, and also then. lowering the system specs for "arcade mode", it`s not needed anyway and. more people could enjoy it as such, two for one more or less. .

their non-emergency number and talk to them
about your problem, they may be able to increase
their patrols on your route at your travel time,
or offer suggestions on alternate routes or
something to avoid this harassment.	Before you go out and get those windows tinted,. be aware that Alberta's laws don't allow tinting. of the side windows in the front.  That said,. you will see vehicles with obviously. after-market tint jobs on all their windows all. over Calgary, Edmonton, Lethbridge, Medicine. Hat, and I'll bet in the rest of the province.. The problem is that this violation is not a high. priority to the enforcement folks, so unless. they are feeling nasty or are not too busy. (rare, I suspect, given the crime rate in the. cities), they won't likely stop you for that. alone.. Speaking of the Police, if you call them at. their non-emergency number and talk to them. about your problem, they may be able to increase. their patrols on your route at your travel time,. or offer suggestions on alternate routes or. something to avoid this harassment.  The Police. don't have much use for hotdoggers in Calgary,. and probably not elsewhere (they charge them. with "stunting", and the courts love to slap. those characters) so they are probably more than. willing to help as far as their resources go.. From another angle, if this harassment is. occurring in a city, and is during your travel. to and from your work after hours, your employer. is required BY LAW to ensure your safety; for. instance, the bank data centres will provide. taxis for their female employees whose shifts. end in the late evening and at night.  This. policy is not limited to Alberta, but is across. Canada.. I don't favour the bigger vehicle strategy, nor. is waving a baseball bat (or some similar. display of defense) a wise ploy.  The former is. giving in and losing your freedom of vehicle. choice (and increasing your driving costs) and. the latter can backfire if you encounter some. yahoo who decides to challenge you to see if you. can and will use your weapon.  In that case,. even if you are willing and able to use it, you. stand a good chance of getting hurt.. One last thing, since you carry a cell, make. sure it is programmed with a one-stroke 911 call. button.  If you are out there and someone really. has you afraid, a single keystroke will put you. on the 911 system.  Even if you can't talk, they. can locate you, since the active phone talks to. the base sites, and the 911 folks can use the. base site locations to pinpoint your position.. Again, there's nothing the blue-and-whites love. better than to nail someone in the act..

Or maybe go out to Shannon and try it. on the main runway (one way to escape landing fees I suppose :-). . Here's another problem I have.  I don't know if this is unique to me. or not (or the airplane: Rallye 880), but when rolling for t/o with a. wind from the left, I run out of right rudder (even in a light. cross-wind).  Once or twice I nearly ended up in the grass and had to. touch the brake slightly to straighten up.  Once I get up a bit of. speed I can steer again just using rudder.  I've taken to starting my. roll on the right side of the runway (even though it's only 30ft. wide).  Anyone else have this problem?. .

My only point was that there is more to a sim than. the framerate, although badly put (but I guess we can all agree on that. anyway, so I didn't have to argue on that).. . But, when it comes to the physiological effects, there seems to be. extremely little hard facts, and I'd like to know if anyone has ever read. or seen anything documenting eye perception, because I do NOT accept. sayings like: "I play better quake in 75 fps than 30 fps, therefore my eye. can tell the difference between 75 and 30 fps...".

0	By
the time I got out of the trap, I was at the back of the pack, out of
sight of the cars ahead of me.	Well, I picked up GPL yesterday, but I didn't have a chance to install. it until this morning, about a half-hour before I had to go to work.. . Here's my system:. . K6-225. 64Mb EDO RAM. 12MB Orchid Righteous 2 (most recent 3dfx reference drivers). CL SB AWE64. Thrustmaster GP1 steering wheel (set about 80% linear). . I installed it, fired it up and went straight for a single race at Monza. with a full field. I set graphics to 800x600, all textures on ahead, no. textures in mirrors, showing only cars and track in mirrors. I don't. remember if I set the objects to "many" or left it on "all". Left all. effects settings per default, except for sounds, which I bumped up to 5. . . I didn't read any documentation, so I didn't know how to access. framerates, but here's my subjective impression:. . In practice, coming out of the pits was choppy but not unmanageable.. Once I got to the first two cars in the pit lane, things smoothed out. (and this was with one car leading out ahead of me). I drove a few. practice laps, everything seemed pretty smooth, the car was very. responsive. My best lap was 1:35.xx (my best in the demo was 1:38.xx),. putting me 11th on the grid.. . Going to the race, I didn't bother changing the default car setup, so I. think I had a full tank of fuel. On the start (man, it's hard to see the. man with the green flag), the framerate was choppy until about where the. track splits for the banking. Controls were still fairly responsive. though. I dropped about 5 positions on the start, but managed to hold my. own through the first turn, running alongside several cars in the back. half of the pack. Framerate was adequate, (not noticeably choppy, though. not entirely smooth) and the car responded quickly to my input. I didn't. notice any drop in framerate while passing cars. . . I made up three or four positions on the first lap. On the second or. third lap, I overshot the Parabolica and ended up in the sandtrap. By. the time I got out of the trap, I was at the back of the pack, out of. sight of the cars ahead of me. I managed on the next two laps to catch. and pass about four or five cars. At the end of lap 5, I realised I. should probably get to work, so I retired and quit the game. I didn't. check to see what my best lap was, though I expect it was comparable to. my best practice lap.. . My conclusion:. The choppiness in the pit lane is of little concern to me. I'll need to. try a few more starts, however (and get some pedals so I can use the. clutch) to find out if the low framerate keeps me from getting as good a. start as I need.. . In the game, with 19 cars on the track, driving with groups of 5-6 cars. ahead and around me, the perceived framerate was quite adequate and, as. I said above, the car was very responsive to my input. I didn't feel as. though there was any lag.. . So, since the HMRC league doesn't begin until December, I feel. comfortable that I don't need to upgrade my system quite yet to get a. few good practice races in before then. My wife will be happy to hear. that, as well.. . Michael Knepher. 
1	Try switching off your landing lights
for a few landings and just concentrate on the far end of the runway.	What you describe seems to be a common problem. I have been flying for. years and still have a tendency to flare high if I have not made recent. night landings. The technique that works best for me is to not judge my. distance from the runway by what's nearest the airplane, but by looking. towards the far end of the runway. Try switching off your landing lights. for a few landings and just concentrate on the far end of the runway. Once. you have established a mental picture of the correct perspective it should. get easier for you.. . Logic Theorist. .
