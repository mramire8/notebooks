Codebase<br>and Accsys are C libraries without SQL. Q+E is a Windows application<br>that can be communicated through Windows DDE calls, where you send a SQL<br>string and receive the results.<br><br>Most people wrote to tell me about the Paradox Engine from Borland. Other <br>products mentioned were: Microsoft's ODBC, Accsys, Quadbase, Codebase,<br>RBASE, and Q+E. Only ODBC, Quadbase, RBASE, and Q+E have SQL.<br><br>For myself, I decided on Codebase, mostly because it has an ANSI C<br>portability version that runs under DOS, UNIX, etc, and includes the<br>source code, and portability is important in my application. It works<br>with DBASE, FoxPro, or Clipper files.<br><br>However, I feel that Microsoft's ODBC looks very promising.<br>It's mostly a formalisation of building and submitting SQL queries, and<br>formatting query results. As the responses say, it's available via ftp,<br>except it's effectively unusuable without two manuals:<br>the ""ODBC Programmer's Reference"" and the ""ODBC SDK Guide"". Moreover,<br>ODBC doesn't actually interpret SQL and liase with databases, that's <br>up to drivers that should be provided by database manufacturers. Also,<br>it's Windows only (it's actually an extension to the Windows SDK). <br>Nevertheless, it's a start at a SQL interface standard, and should<br>make life interesting in the future.<br><br>Here's my original post, followed by the responses, separated by <br>a line of asterisks (*).<br><br><br>****************************************************************************<br><br>Borland has a product called Paradox Engine that does just what you want. <br>The current version is 3.0, which is fully compatible with (ack) Paradox<br>4.0.

I<br>have tried numerous setting on the IRQ bank without success. I assume that<br>this bank must tell the card which IRQ's to use for both ports, but I don;t<br>know how.  Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!!<br><br>EBD<br>-- <br>Elliot Dierksen   ""Is that a real poncho... I mean is that a Mexican poncho or<br>                   is that a Sears  poncho?

106	1	"In going with the modern trend, the Orchid P9000 card only supports 16 colors<br>in 640x480 mode without a driver.  Of course, this breaks any DOS program<br>which uses SVGA modes (like most of my CD-ROMs).  The Compudyne Whiplash VGA,<br>Orchid Fahrenheit 1280, and Orchid F. VLB all share this limitation.  Those<br>are all S3 cards, which means it is an S3 problem for them (the P9000 uses<br>a Weitek VGA chip which also doesn't support them).  The Hercules Graphite<br>card does seem to have these modes, but I didn't run the same test cases as<br>I did on the other boards during the brief time I had it.  It was able to<br>print the splash screen for the Grolier's Encyclopedia, though, which the S3<br>cards just printed as hash, which is why I suspect the SVGA modes are supported.<br><br>The supported resolutions really annoy me.  You can do 1280x1024 at 75Hz if<br>you tell the driver you have an NEC 5FG (they only have about six monitors<br>listed plus 'Generic', and if you choose Generic you can't get any high<br>refreshes at ALL).  But at 1024x768 you are limited to 70Hz.  Seems to me<br>that the hardware should be able to support the bandwidth (if it can do 75Hz<br>at 1280 it sure should be able to do it at 1024!).

"In going with the modern trend, the Orchid P9000 card only supports 16 colors<br>in 640x480 mode without a driver.  Of course, this breaks any DOS program<br>which uses SVGA modes (like most of my CD-ROMs).  The Compudyne Whiplash VGA,<br>Orchid Fahrenheit 1280, and Orchid F. VLB all share this limitation.  Those<br>are all S3 cards, which means it is an S3 problem for them (the P9000 uses<br>a Weitek VGA chip which also doesn't support them).  The Hercules Graphite<br>card does seem to have these modes, but I didn't run the same test cases as<br>I did on the other boards during the brief time I had it.  It was able to<br>print the splash screen for the Grolier's Encyclopedia, though, which the S3<br>cards just printed as hash, which is why I suspect the SVGA modes are supported.<br><br>The supported resolutions really annoy me.  You can do 1280x1024 at 75Hz if<br>you tell the driver you have an NEC 5FG (they only have about six monitors<br>listed plus 'Generic', and if you choose Generic you can't get any high<br>refreshes at ALL).  But at 1024x768 you are limited to 70Hz.  Seems to me<br>that the hardware should be able to support the bandwidth (if it can do 75Hz<br>at 1280 it sure should be able to do it at 1024!).

Those are<br>what control what drive the controller thinks it has.   If you have<br>the 62-000042-015 rom, set it like this:<br><br>              5 + +    open<br>              6 + +    open             <br>              7 + +    open        <br>              8 + +    open<br>              4 + +    closed<br>              3 + +    closed<br>              2 + +    open<br>              1 + +    open<br><br>    Note:   those are how WD runs the numbers on the jumper block.<br>Top to bottom.   +'s represent the jumper pins.

I don't have the big book right here.<br><br><br>      See above.  You might have problems if the S1 jumpers are not<br>right.

Enter:<br>       <br>        -d f000:fff5 fffc    (the - is the debug prompt)<br>   <br>    This will return the rom date, if it's of any use.<br><br><br>      If I oversimplified any of the above, I appologize.

It supports 2 RLL <br>          drives with up to 16 heads and 1024 cylinders.  Built-in ROM <br>          BIOS supports non-standard drive types, virtual drive <br>          formatting, bad track formatting and dynamic formatting.<br>          <br>          NOTE 1:  AT&T 6300 - The AT&T 6300 and the AT&T 6300 PLUS <br>          contain system BIOS chips that support the hard disk drive.  <br>          When using a Western Digital XT controller card the system will <br>          not ""boot.""  To solve this problem, one of the ROM BIOS chips <br>          must be disabled.  To disable the BIOS on your Western Digital  <br>          XT controller card, you must remove the jumper at position W-3 <br>          or add a jumper at position R-23 (depending on which model of XT <br>          controller you are using).<br>          <br>                                       -2-<br><br><br>          <br>          NOTE 2:  TANDY 1000 SYSTEMS - The WD1002A-WX1, WD1004A-WX1, <br>          WDXT-GEN2 and the WD1004-27X can be modified to operate in <br>          Tandy 1000 series computers, models SX, TX and the original or <br>          ""A"" version.  These computers utilize an interrupt of 2 (IRQ2) <br>          instead of IRQ5, the IBM standard.  To modify the WD1002A-WX1 or <br>          the WD1002-27X to operate in these systems, you must cut the <br>          etch between pin 1 and pin 2 at jumper position W-7.  Then <br>          solder pin 2 and pin 3 at the position (W-7).  To complete the <br>          modification, a jumper must be added to position 7 of switch S-1 <br>          (2 rows of 8 pins).  PLEASE NOTE THAT ANY PHYSICAL MODIFICATION <br>          TO YOUR WESTERN DIGITAL HARD DISK CONTROLLER VOIDS THE WARRANTY <br>          ON YOUR BOARD.  To modify the WD1004A-WX1, WDXT-GEN2 or the <br>          WD1004-27X for your Tandy 1000 system, a zero ohm resister must <br>          be soldered to jumper position W-27.  This will change the <br>          interrupt from IRQ5 to IRQ2.<br>     <br>     <br>     XT CONTROLLERS FOR FLOPPY DISK DRIVES<br>     <br>          <br>          WD1002A-FOX - Half-slot floppy disk controller for XT or AT  <br>          systems.

It should be the only non-smt chip on<br>the board.  Slightly below center, and left.

W5 and W7 are factory jumped (with a trace) between<br>pins 1 and 2 to select the primary controller address.<br><br><br>    Looks right.<br>  <br>[art deleted]<br><br><br>      I notice you left out the S1 jumper table settings.   Those are<br>what control what drive the controller thinks it has.   If you have<br>the 62-000042-015 rom, set it like this:<br><br>              5 + +    open<br>              6 + +    open             <br>              7 + +    open        <br>              8 + +    open<br>              4 + +    closed<br>              3 + +    closed<br>              2 + +    open<br>              1 + +    open<br><br>    Note:   those are how WD runs the numbers on the jumper block.<br>Top to bottom.   +'s represent the jumper pins.    Pins 3,4, and 8<br>select the first drive setting (drive 0) and pins 1,2 and 7 select the<br>second drive (drive 1).   <br><br>      If you have the 62-000094 rom, it's a auto-config, and I'll have<br>to look up how to do it... I don't have the big book right here.<br><br><br>      See above.  You might have problems if the S1 jumpers are not<br>right.   Also,  at the risk of being insulting, make sure the cables<br>are on right and good. 8).    On the jumper on the 251, try moving it<br>to the opposite side of the drive.    It's one or the other.   <br>     The narrow data cable goes to J2.   I've thrown it on J3 a few<br>times and banged my head for a day.....<br><br><br>     Dunno.    IBM roms had to be later than 10/27/82.   A quick way<br>to check is to boot dos and run debug.   Enter:<br>       <br>        -d f000:fff5 fffc    (the - is the debug prompt)<br>   <br>    This will return the rom date, if it's of any use.<br><br><br>      If I oversimplified any of the above, I appologize.     It's<br>just hard to know what caliber of person I'm talking to. 8).<br><br>                     -->   Bob Valentine  <--  <br>                  --> ravalent@mailbox.syr.edu <--  <br><br><br><br>From chpp@unitrix.utr.ac.za Mon Apr  5 06:33:46 1993<br>Received: from unitrix.utr.ac.za by ponder (5.61/1.36)<br> id AA16194; Mon, 5 Apr 93 06:32:59 -0500<br>Received: by unitrix.utr.ac.za (Smail3.1.28.1 #1)<br> id m0nfpMA-0001X7C; Mon, 5 Apr 93 13:28 GMT<br>Message-Id: <m0nfpMA-0001X7C@unitrix.utr.ac.za><br>From: chpp@unitrix.utr.ac.za (Prof P.

The family ranges from<br> Modular Windows through Windows 3.1 and Windows for Workgroups to<br> Windows NT at the high end.  To date, Microsoft has shipped over<br> 50,000 beta copies and pre-release SDKs of Windows NT -- the<br> actual release is slated for May/June '93.<br><br> While Windows NT has an entirely new design internally, it shares<br> an application programming interface with the other members of the<br> Windows family; its Win32 API includes the Win16 API used in Win-<br> dows 3.1, and the Win32s API subset (Win32 less threads, networking<br> and security) can be used to create 32-bit applications for<br> Windows 3.1.<br><br> The user interface is also practically identical to that of Windows<br> 3.1, with the addition of logins and a few other features.  It uses<br> Program Manager, File Manager and other applets, and generally pre-<br> sents an identical appearance to the user.  Many of the announced<br> Windows NT applications are ports of existing Windows 3.1 apps, and<br> NT also runs existing 3.1 applications.<br><br> Thus, it appears logical that Windows NT should share the following<br> groups with the other members of the Windows family:<br>  comp.os.ms-windows.apps<br>  comp.os.ms-windows.programmer.tools<br>  comp.os.ms-windows.programmer.misc<br>  comp.os.ms-windows.programmer.win32<br> <br> The following groups are also clearly applicable to Windows NT as<br> well as Windows 3.1:<br>  comp.os.ms-windows.announce<br>  comp.os.ms-windows.advocacy<br> <br> In conclusion, the only clear argument for the separation of the<br> Windows 3.1 and Windows NT hierarchies is different internal<br> structures of Windows 3.1 and Windows NT.  And yet operating<br> systems such as OS/2, Macintosh OS, Xenix and Coherent all have<br> undergone major rewrites without having been split into separate<br> newsgroup hierarchies.<br><br> Further, Windows 3.1 is due for a major rewrite itself in 1994 --<br> when the fully 32-bit, protected-mode and with-DOS-built-in next-<br> generation Windows, ""Chicago"", debuts next year, surely it should<br> remain in the same hierarchy.  And what, then, would be the jus-<br> tification for separating Windows NT from other Windows versions?<br><br><br>DISCUSSION PERIOD:<br> The discussion period will run from 27 April, 1992 to 18 May, 1993.  <br><br>VOTING:<br> The CFV (Call for Votes) will be issued around 19 May, 1993, based on<br> the feedback received during the discussion period.

To date, Microsoft has shipped over<br> 50,000 beta copies and pre-release SDKs of Windows NT -- the<br> actual release is slated for May/June '93.<br><br> While Windows NT has an entirely new design internally, it shares<br> an application programming interface with the other members of the<br> Windows family; its Win32 API includes the Win16 API used in Win-<br> dows 3.1, and the Win32s API subset (Win32 less threads, networking<br> and security) can be used to create 32-bit applications for<br> Windows 3.1.<br><br> The user interface is also practically identical to that of Windows<br> 3.1, with the addition of logins and a few other features.  It uses<br> Program Manager, File Manager and other applets, and generally pre-<br> sents an identical appearance to the user.  Many of the announced<br> Windows NT applications are ports of existing Windows 3.1 apps, and<br> NT also runs existing 3.1 applications.<br><br> Thus, it appears logical that Windows NT should share the following<br> groups with the other members of the Windows family:<br>  comp.os.ms-windows.apps<br>  comp.os.ms-windows.programmer.tools<br>  comp.os.ms-windows.programmer.misc<br>  comp.os.ms-windows.programmer.win32<br> <br> The following groups are also clearly applicable to Windows NT as<br> well as Windows 3.1:<br>  comp.os.ms-windows.announce<br>  comp.os.ms-windows.advocacy<br> <br> In conclusion, the only clear argument for the separation of the<br> Windows 3.1 and Windows NT hierarchies is different internal<br> structures of Windows 3.1 and Windows NT.  And yet operating<br> systems such as OS/2, Macintosh OS, Xenix and Coherent all have<br> undergone major rewrites without having been split into separate<br> newsgroup hierarchies.<br><br> Further, Windows 3.1 is due for a major rewrite itself in 1994 --<br> when the fully 32-bit, protected-mode and with-DOS-built-in next-<br> generation Windows, ""Chicago"", debuts next year, surely it should<br> remain in the same hierarchy.  And what, then, would be the jus-<br> tification for separating Windows NT from other Windows versions?<br><br><br>DISCUSSION PERIOD:<br> The discussion period will run from 27 April, 1992 to 18 May, 1993.  <br><br>VOTING:<br> The CFV (Call for Votes) will be issued around 19 May, 1993, based on<br> the feedback received during the discussion period.  No votes will<br> be accepted prior to the CFV."

However, just in case<br>something went wrong, I'm going to describe some of the changes needed<br>to get Windows 3.1 working with the 1542.  Also, you may have noticed<br>that installing Windows 3.1 makes your PC run much slower, even when<br>you're not running Windows; methods of speeding it up are discussed in<br>the section called, ""Windows 3.1 runs slowly"".<br><br><br>* MSDOS configuration:<br><br>     The Windows install program adds the SmartDrive disk cache to your<br>CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files.  If you follow the instructions,<br>you'll notice that you'll need to use double-buffering with SmartDrive<br>(this is the default setup).  You'll also notice that your system runs<br>much, much slower -- in both Windows *AND* MSDOS.  See the section<br>called, ""Windows 3.1 runs slowly"", for some ways of speeding your system<br>up.<br><br><br>* Windows configuration:<br><br>     To get the Adaptec 1542 to work with Windows, make sure that the<br>""[388Enh]"" section of the SYSTEM.INI file contains the entry:<br><br> VirtualHDIRQ=Off<br><br>I believe that the Windows install program automatically adds this entry<br>to SYSTEM.INI, but I'm not sure.  If this doesn't work for you, you<br>might want to try adding some more lines:<br><br> VirtualHDIRQ=Off<br> SystemROMBreakPoint=false<br> EMMExclude=A000-CFFF<br><br>(You probably don't need the above lines, though.)  The<br>""SystemROMBreakPoint"" entry is used to enable support for memory<br>managers like QEMM/386MAX (only needed if you use such programs).<br><br><br>* Windows 3.1 runs slowly:<br><br>     Once you do get Windows 3.1 running with the 1542, chances are that<br>your system is running much slower than before.  If it's not, it's<br>probably because:<br><br>     1. You happen to be using ASPI4DOS.SYS version 3.1 in your<br> CONFIG.SYS file.  Congratulations -- this appears to be a<br> winning solution.<br><br>     2. You are very lucky.  Whether your luck will hold out remains to<br> be seen ....<br><br>If your system is running much slower than before, this is almost<br>definitely caused by Smartdrive with double-buffering.  According to the<br>Windows documentation, and the Microsoft technical note #Q81808<br>(""SMARTDrive Double Buffering Required with ASPI4DOS.SYS""), you must use<br>Smartdrive with double-buffering enabled.  While this works, it really<br>slows down your PC; I once estimated that this slowed my PC down by a<br>factor of 5 (FIVE).  As I consider this unacceptable, I looked for other<br>solutions.<br><br>     Unfortunately, you cannot just disable double-buffering.  If you<br>do, Windows 3.1 in enhanced mode will not work, and you might even<br>destroy the contents of your hard disk by trying to run Windows 3.1.<br>What you can do is one of the following:<br><br>     1. Use other drivers that provide double-buffering.  It is my<br> opinion that the unbelievable slowness in Smartdrive is caused<br> either by horribly inefficient double-buffering, or by a bug in<br> Smartdrive.<br><br>     2. Use a driver that provides ""VDS"" services (""VDS"" stands for<br> ""Virtual DMA Services"").  This is a standard, which is supported<br> by Windows 3.1, that allows bus-mastering disk controllers (like<br> the 1542) to work with Windows.<br><br>     After trashing my hard disk countless times, I found the following<br>solutions, none of which require using Smartdrive (note, however, that I<br>am now getting occasional parity errors, which are probably *NOT* caused<br>by these solutions, but might be -- see below).  While the following<br>does not require Smartdrive, using some kind of disk cache utility is<br>strongly recommended, as this makes Windows run much, much faster:<br><br>1. If you do not have the ASPI4DOS.SYS driver, or you do not need ASPI<br>   functions (for controlling a CDROM, tape drive, more than two<br>   physical hard disks, etc.), you can add the SCSIHA.SYS driver to your<br>   CONFIG.SYS file, e.g.:<br><br> DRIVER=c:\SCSIHA.SYS /V386<br><br>   (Windows needs the ""/V386"" option.)  This driver MUST be loaded into<br>   LOW memory (it cannot be loaded into high memory), and it occupies<br>   about 16-20K.  As of November 1992, the SCSIHA.SYS driver could be<br>   obtained from the Adaptec BBS at (408)-945-7727 (hopefully, it's<br>   still there).<br><br>2. If you need ASPI functions and have the ASPI4DOS.SYS driver, version<br>   3.0 or 3.0a, you can use both the ASPI4DOS.SYS and SCSIHA.SYS drivers<br>   in your CONFIG.SYS file, e.g.:<br><br> DRIVER=c:\ASPI4DOS.SYS<br> DRIVER=c:\SCSIHA.SYS /V386<br><br>   Amazingly enough, the SCSIHA.SYS driver can also be loaded high<br>   (assuming you have DOS 5.0); I would have thought that this would<br>   crash my system, but it doesn't.  I asked Adaptec's technical support<br>   about this, and they said that loading SCSIHA.SYS high should be fine<br>   as long as ASPI4DOS.SYS is loaded LOW.<br><br>   On my system, NOT using SCSIHA.SYS with ASPI4DOS 3.0a would<br>   occasionally cause Windows 3.1 to crash upon restarting or exiting<br>   Windows, with the additional result of a corrupted disk (some of my<br>   C:\WINDOWS\*.GRP files would be corrupted).  For me, these crashes<br>   usually occurred while making a different program from PROGMAN.EXE<br>   the default Windows shell, and vice-versa.  This is the reason<br>   SCSIHA.SYS may be necessary.<br><br>   I have absolutely no idea if SCSIHA.SYS is necessary with versions of<br>   ASPI4DOS earlier than 3.0.<br><br>   Note that many people can use ASPI4DOS 3.0 or 3.0a without<br>   SCSIHA.SYS; they do not seem to have any problems at all.  I consider<br>   these people lucky.  Others, like me, have had all sorts of problems.<br><br>3. In my opinion, the best, but not necessarily the easiest, solution is<br>   to upgrade to ASPI4DOS 3.1.  The SCSIHA.SYS driver is no longer<br>   needed.  Unfortunately, while you could get previous ASPI4DOS<br>   upgrades from the Adaptec BBS, the ASPI4DOS 3.1 driver is not<br>   available from the Adaptec BBS.  As far as I know, there are only<br>   three ways to get a copy:<br><br>      * You can buy the new (as of November 1992) Adaptec EZ SCSI driver<br> kit, which supposedly includes ASPI4DOS 3.1 as well as other<br> drivers, such as CDROM drivers.  I believe the list price is<br> around $75.<br><br>      * If you already have a copy of an older version of ASPI4DOS, you<br> can supposedly contact Adaptec to upgrade it to EZ SCSI for<br> around $30.<br><br>      * A copy of ASPI4DOS 3.1 is included in Central Point PC Tools 8.0<br> for MSDOS.  Note that the documentation and driver are stored in<br> different directories.  Note further that only ASPI4DOS is<br> included; the CDROM drivers and drivers to support more than two<br> hard disks are not included.  This is where I obtained my copy<br> of ASPI4DOS 3.1.<br><br>Note, however, that I am now getting occasional parity errors with<br>Windows.  In all probability, defective hardware in my PC is causing<br>this, as I upgraded my motherboard just after I found the above<br>solutions.  However, because these parity errors occur only during disk<br>accesses, there is a very small, but definite, possibility that the<br>parity errors are driver-related (for example, changing the bus on/off<br>timing for certain disk transfers might cause this).  I've run various<br>memory tests for hours at a time, and these tests have found no<br>problems.  This problem is probably caused by memory with marginal<br>timing requirements, which cause parity errors during disk transfers<br>(this is why the memory tests didn't find any problems -- the problems<br>show up only under disk I/O).  However, I'm mentioning this just in case<br>it isn't a hardware problem.<br><br><br>***** Floppy-controller-based tape backup devices:<br><br>     There are two possible problems with using the Adaptec 1542 with a<br>floppy-controller-based tape backup device, such as the Colorado Memory<br>Systems Jumbo 250:<br><br>1. Tape backups/restores can take a very long time.  The tape drive<br>   constantly starts, stops, starts, stops, etc.<br><br>2. Tape operations may be erratic, or encounter too many tape errors.<br>   (This problem might be caused by defective hardware on my 1542.<br>   However, I've heard of other people having similar problems, and so<br>   I'm mentioning this just in case it is not a hardware problem on my<br>   1542.)<br><br><br>* Tape backups/restores take a long time:<br><br>     If you have a floppy-controller-based tape backup device, you may<br>have to adjust the Adaptec 1540/1542 ""bus on/off timing"" for best<br>results when using the tape drive.  Normally, while doing a tape backup<br>or restore, the tape drive motor should be continuously running, with<br>only an occasional pause.  However, the default bus timing on the<br>Adaptec 1540/1542 may cause the tape drive motor to start and stop,<br>start and stop, every few seconds.  This causes needless wear to the<br>tape and tape drive (however, note that a dirty tape head or a defective<br>tape drive can also cause this -- make sure your tape heads are clean).<br>This also causes the tape backup or restore to take much, much longer<br>than necessary.<br><br>     The problem here is that these tape backups use the floppy DMA to<br>transfer data in memory to/from the tape drive, and the Adaptec uses DMA<br>to transfer data in memory to/from the hard disk.  The floppy DMA needs<br>to feed data to the tape drive at a certain rate; if the tape drive is<br>not fed data quickly enough by the floppy DMA, the tape drive stops,<br>rewinds a bit, and restarts (once enough data is eventually fed to it).<br>The default bus timing on the Adaptec (which is really DMA timing) is<br>""too large"".  For example, when a backup is done, data has to be<br>transferred from a hard disk to memory, and then from memory to the<br>tape.  Because the default timing on the Adaptec ""hogs"" the memory too<br>much (too much time is spent transferring data from a hard disk to<br>memory), not enough time is spent transferring data from memory to the<br>tape drive.  As a result, the tape drive constantly starts and stops,<br>because data is not fed to it quickly enough.<br><br>     The solution is to change the Adaptec's bus on/off timing.  The<br>default factory setting is 11 microseconds on, and 5 microseconds off.<br>The ""bus on"" timing needs to be lowered to 2-4 microseconds.  This can<br>be done in one of two ways:<br><br>* If you have ASPI4DOS, you can use the ""/n"" option.  For example, I use<br>  a ""bus on"" timing of 4 microseconds, which means that I use the<br>  following line in my CONFIG.SYS file:<br><br> DEVICE=c:\aspi4dos.sys /n4<br><br>  Note that there is NO space between the ""/n"" and the ""4"".<br><br>* If you don't have ASPI4DOS, your only recourse is to try to find a<br>  program called ""SETSCSI.EXE"", which is very difficult to find.  The<br>  reason is that Adaptec, for reasons of their own, does not seem to<br>  want this widely distributed.  I once asked someone who worked for<br>  Adaptec, and they asked me to not upload it anywhere.  If you have<br>  anonymous ftp access to the Internet, you could try using archie to<br>  hunt down a copy; I believe that there are a couple of sites that have<br>  it.  If you do find a copy, you run it like so:<br><br> setscsi -n:4<br><br>  This adjusts the ""bus on"" timing to 4 microseconds.  Running<br>  SETSCSI.EXE without any arguments resets the bus timing back to the<br>  factory defaults.<br><br>  Note that it seems that you cannot use SETSCSI.EXE if you use<br>  ASPI4DOS; SETSCSI.EXE crashed my system if ASPI4DOS was loaded.  I<br>  could use SETSCSI.EXE with SCSIHA.SYS, however.<br><br>Do not lower the ""bus on"" timing below 2 microseconds, or increase it<br>above 11 microseconds.  If you lower it too low, the hard disk<br>throughput will suddenly drop; your system will feel slower.  For me, 4<br>microseconds works fine.  This value may work fine for you, or you may<br>have to adjust it downwards a little.<br><br>     Once you've lowered the ""bus on"" timing, tape backups and restores<br>should run faster.<br><br>     Also, do not experiment with the bus on/off times (with the other<br>options that I have intentionally not described), unless you know what<br>you are doing.  Bad combinations can cause parity errors and worse, by<br>starving memory refresh.<br><br>     A program called BUSTIFIX.EXE exists on the Adaptec BBS.  Unless<br>this has been upgraded since I last checked (which has been a while),<br>this is a self-extracting archive containing a batch file and a couple<br>of other files.  This batch file was supposed to allow one to set the<br>bus on/off times for the 1540/1542 and others.  However, when I tried<br>running this program with my 1542A, my system crashed.  At the time, I<br>was running SCSIHA.SYS, and I didn't check to see if there was a<br>conflict with it.  Maybe this old program works only with the 1542B,<br>although the docs say that it works with the 1542A?<br><br><br>* Erratic tape operations or too many tape errors:<br><br>     This ""problem"" may or may not exist.  Although it existed on my<br>system, a hardware problem just on my particular 1542 could cause it.<br>However, I've heard of other people having similar problems, and so I'm<br>mentioning this just in case it isn't a hardware problem just on my<br>1542.<br><br>     Symptoms of this ""problem"", which persists even after cleaning the<br>tape head:<br><br>1. Backing up to tape encounters ""unusable sector detected"" errors,<br>   resulting in an aborted tape backup.<br><br>2. Tape backup works, but the tape compare fails.<br><br>3. The tape drive starts, stops, starts, stops, etc. much too often.<br>   Unlike the above-mentioned problem (""Tape backups/restores take a<br>   long time""), where the tape drive starts and stops every few seconds,<br>   this kind of starting/stopping occurs every few 10-20 seconds or so.<br><br>4. Fastback Plus 3.1 does not find/see any tape backup devices.  Other<br>   programs, like Central Point Backup and the CMS Jumbo software<br>   (assuming that you have a CMS Jumbo 250 tape drive) can find/see the<br>   tape drive, but Fastback Plus 3.1 cannot.<br><br>5. Too many tape read errors.<br><br>     Although I do not know what is causing this problem, I discovered<br>that using a different floppy controller solves it.  A few months ago, I<br>upgraded my motherboard, which contained an integrated floppy<br>controller.  As I already had a floppy controller on the 1542, I<br>initially disabled the motherboard floppy controller.  After a while, I<br>decided to try disabling the 1542 floppy controller and using the one on<br>the motherboard.  When I did this, the tape drive (a CMS Jumbo 250)<br>reliability increased dramatically, and Fastback Plus 3.1 was suddenly<br>able to find and use the tape drive.<br><br>     I don't know if this was caused by a hardware problem on my 1542.<br>On the one hand, the floppy drives worked great when they were attached<br>to the 1542, which seems to say that there was nothing wrong with the<br>1542.  On the other hand, the tape drive didn't work well attached to<br>the 1542 floppy controller, but it did work when attached to a different<br>controller; this could be an indication of a hardware problem on my<br>1542.  I did change floppy drive cables, and so it is conceivable that<br>the problem was in the cables.  I don't know what the cause really is;<br>however, if you're having similar problems, you might want to consider<br>trying a new floppy controller.<br><br><br>***** Sound cards:<br><br>     Many popular sound cards can play or record digitized sound, and<br>this is typically done using DMA.  Like the tape drive DMA, the<br>Adaptec's DMA can conflict with the sound card DMA.  Unlike that of the<br>tape DMA, this ""conflict"" usually manifests itself as a parity error<br>(your system crashes with a parity error message).  What happens is<br>that, data is being transferred so quickly by the sound card and the<br>Adaptec, memory refresh cannot occur quickly enough, which causes a<br>parity error.  Usually, getting a parity error means that there is a<br>hardware problem with your system; in this case, however, the parity<br>error is not a symptom of bad hardware.<br><br>     I've found that such parity errors typically occur while recording<br>digitized sound, and the chances of such errors increase as you increase<br>the recording fidelity (e.g., higher sampling rate, recording in stereo,<br>recording using 16-bits instead of 8, etc.).<br><br>     Like the tape drive solution, the solution here is to lower the<br>Adaptec's ""bus on"" timing.  See the section on tape drives for<br>information on how this is done.  Note, however, that this may or may<br>not solve the problem; it may only reduce the probability of a parity<br>error.  The software used to record digitized sound can greatly affect<br>this problem (i.e., some software is inefficient).  Disk caches, the<br>speed of your hard disk, and the amount of disk fragmentation can also<br>affect this.<br><br><br>***** Miscellaneous info:<br><br>     This section contains miscellaneous hints, tips, and rumors.  Much<br>of it is merely information that I've heard or read about, and have not<br>verified.  I believe that the following information is correct, but I'm<br>not sure.  Use it at your own risk.<br><br>* With QEMM 6.00, 6.01, and 6.02, you need to specify the ""DB=""<br>  parameter (e.g., ""DB=2""), unless you are using the ASPI4DOS driver.<br>  If you don't, QEMM will crash/hang at bootup.  Although the QEMM<br>  manual mentions this, the install program does not seem to detect that<br>  a 1542 is present and automatically add this option to the QEMM<br>  command line (at least, this occurred with the QEMM 6.00 install<br>  program -- I haven't tested any other version).  Earlier versions of<br>  QEMM probably need this parameter, but I'm not sure (I've never used a<br>  version earlier than 6.00).<br><br>  If you use ASPI4DOS, you do not need to give QEMM the ""DB="" parameter.<br><br>* Some or all versions of the 1542 do not support hard disks over one<br>  gigabyte in size.  To support hard disks with capacities over 1GB, you<br>  need to get a new ROM BIOS from Adaptec.  I'm not sure if this is<br>  still true of the latest 1542Bs being sold by Adaptec.<br><br>* To connect a CDROM drive to the 1542, you need a SCSI CDROM drive and<br>  some drivers.  Note that some CDROM drives have proprietary interfaces<br>  (non-SCSI); these drives cannot be used with the 1542.  You have three<br>  choices for CDROM drivers (I have no idea how well the following<br>  solutions work, or even if they work -- the following is secondhand<br>  information):<br><br>     1. You can buy Adaptec's EZ SCSI driver package, which lists for<br> something like $75.  If you already have older Adaptec drivers,<br> you can supposedly upgrade to EZ SCSI for around $30.  Contact<br> Adaptec for details.  The EZ SCSI package supposedly contains<br> everything that you need.<br><br>     2. You can buy the CorelSCSI! driver package, which is made by the<br> same people that make CorelDRAW!  This package contains CDROM<br> drivers, SCSI tape drivers, WORM drivers, etc.  I do not know<br> the list price, but I've seen this package sold for around<br> $80-$90.  Note that CorelSCSI! does not come with the ASPI4DOS<br> driver, which is needed.  If you do not already have ASPI4DOS,<br> you may be better off getting Adaptec's EZ SCSI instead.<br><br>     3. [This method is obsolete, as the following drivers have been<br> obsoleted by Adaptec's EZ SCSI kit, but I'm mentioning it in<br> case someone already has these drivers.]  You can use the<br> drivers in the Adaptec ASW-1410 kit (ASPI4DOS) and the ASW-410<br> kit (ASPI CDROM drivers).  You will have to get a copy of<br> MSCDEX.EXE (a high-level CDROM driver), if it is not included in<br> the ASW-410 kit, but this is available from several bulletin<br> boards.<br><br>* To use a SCSI tape drive with the 1542, you need software that knows<br>  how to talk to a SCSI tape drive.  Software that I've heard about are<br>  (again, like the above section on CDROM drives, I have no idea how<br>  well the following solutions work, or even if they work -- the<br>  following is secondhand information):<br><br>     1. Central Point PC Tools 8.0 for MSDOS supposedly supports a large<br> number of SCSI tape drives.  It comes with SCSI drivers<br> (ASPI4DOS 3.1) as well as Central Point Backup.<br><br>     2. The CorelSCSI! driver package contains a SCSI tape backup<br> program (see the above section on CDROM drives for more<br> details).  However, note that CorelSCSI! does not come with, but<br> requires, ASPI4DOS.<br><br>* I've seen advertisements that sell the 1542 in three configurations:<br><br>     1. 1542 SCSI controller with hard disk ROM BIOS.<br>     2. 1542 SCSI controller w/BIOS and Adaptec ASPI drivers.<br>     3. 1542 SCSI controller w/BIOS, Adaptec ASPI drivers, and<br> CorelSCSI! drivers/programs.<br><br>  I imagine that Adaptec now sells the 1542 in a fourth configuration:<br><br>     4. 1542 SCSI controller w/BIOS and EZ SCSI drivers (including ASPI<br> drivers).<br><br>* Those people who use Unix might be interested in a version of GNU tar<br>  for MSDOS that talks to a SCSI tape drive via the ASPI4DOS driver (you<br>  need this driver before you can use this program).  I've never used<br>  this version of GNU tar, but I've heard that it works (I don't know<br>  how well, though).

Also, you may have noticed<br>that installing Windows 3.1 makes your PC run much slower, even when<br>you're not running Windows; methods of speeding it up are discussed in<br>the section called, ""Windows 3.1 runs slowly"".<br><br><br>* MSDOS configuration:<br><br>     The Windows install program adds the SmartDrive disk cache to your<br>CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files.  If you follow the instructions,<br>you'll notice that you'll need to use double-buffering with SmartDrive<br>(this is the default setup).  You'll also notice that your system runs<br>much, much slower -- in both Windows *AND* MSDOS.  See the section<br>called, ""Windows 3.1 runs slowly"", for some ways of speeding your system<br>up.<br><br><br>* Windows configuration:<br><br>     To get the Adaptec 1542 to work with Windows, make sure that the<br>""[388Enh]"" section of the SYSTEM.INI file contains the entry:<br><br> VirtualHDIRQ=Off<br><br>I believe that the Windows install program automatically adds this entry<br>to SYSTEM.INI, but I'm not sure.  If this doesn't work for you, you<br>might want to try adding some more lines:<br><br> VirtualHDIRQ=Off<br> SystemROMBreakPoint=false<br> EMMExclude=A000-CFFF<br><br>(You probably don't need the above lines, though.)  The<br>""SystemROMBreakPoint"" entry is used to enable support for memory<br>managers like QEMM/386MAX (only needed if you use such programs).<br><br><br>* Windows 3.1 runs slowly:<br><br>     Once you do get Windows 3.1 running with the 1542, chances are that<br>your system is running much slower than before.  If it's not, it's<br>probably because:<br><br>     1. You happen to be using ASPI4DOS.SYS version 3.1 in your<br> CONFIG.SYS file.  Congratulations -- this appears to be a<br> winning solution.<br><br>     2. You are very lucky.  Whether your luck will hold out remains to<br> be seen ....<br><br>If your system is running much slower than before, this is almost<br>definitely caused by Smartdrive with double-buffering.  According to the<br>Windows documentation, and the Microsoft technical note #Q81808<br>(""SMARTDrive Double Buffering Required with ASPI4DOS.SYS""), you must use<br>Smartdrive with double-buffering enabled.  While this works, it really<br>slows down your PC; I once estimated that this slowed my PC down by a<br>factor of 5 (FIVE).  As I consider this unacceptable, I looked for other<br>solutions.<br><br>     Unfortunately, you cannot just disable double-buffering.  If you<br>do, Windows 3.1 in enhanced mode will not work, and you might even<br>destroy the contents of your hard disk by trying to run Windows 3.1.<br>What you can do is one of the following:<br><br>     1. Use other drivers that provide double-buffering.  It is my<br> opinion that the unbelievable slowness in Smartdrive is caused<br> either by horribly inefficient double-buffering, or by a bug in<br> Smartdrive.<br><br>     2. Use a driver that provides ""VDS"" services (""VDS"" stands for<br> ""Virtual DMA Services"").  This is a standard, which is supported<br> by Windows 3.1, that allows bus-mastering disk controllers (like<br> the 1542) to work with Windows.<br><br>     After trashing my hard disk countless times, I found the following<br>solutions, none of which require using Smartdrive (note, however, that I<br>am now getting occasional parity errors, which are probably *NOT* caused<br>by these solutions, but might be -- see below).  While the following<br>does not require Smartdrive, using some kind of disk cache utility is<br>strongly recommended, as this makes Windows run much, much faster:<br><br>1. If you do not have the ASPI4DOS.SYS driver, or you do not need ASPI<br>   functions (for controlling a CDROM, tape drive, more than two<br>   physical hard disks, etc.), you can add the SCSIHA.SYS driver to your<br>   CONFIG.SYS file, e.g.:<br><br> DRIVER=c:\SCSIHA.SYS /V386<br><br>   (Windows needs the ""/V386"" option.)  This driver MUST be loaded into<br>   LOW memory (it cannot be loaded into high memory), and it occupies<br>   about 16-20K.  As of November 1992, the SCSIHA.SYS driver could be<br>   obtained from the Adaptec BBS at (408)-945-7727 (hopefully, it's<br>   still there).<br><br>2. If you need ASPI functions and have the ASPI4DOS.SYS driver, version<br>   3.0 or 3.0a, you can use both the ASPI4DOS.SYS and SCSIHA.SYS drivers<br>   in your CONFIG.SYS file, e.g.:<br><br> DRIVER=c:\ASPI4DOS.SYS<br> DRIVER=c:\SCSIHA.SYS /V386<br><br>   Amazingly enough, the SCSIHA.SYS driver can also be loaded high<br>   (assuming you have DOS 5.0); I would have thought that this would<br>   crash my system, but it doesn't.  I asked Adaptec's technical support<br>   about this, and they said that loading SCSIHA.SYS high should be fine<br>   as long as ASPI4DOS.SYS is loaded LOW.<br><br>   On my system, NOT using SCSIHA.SYS with ASPI4DOS 3.0a would<br>   occasionally cause Windows 3.1 to crash upon restarting or exiting<br>   Windows, with the additional result of a corrupted disk (some of my<br>   C:\WINDOWS\*.GRP files would be corrupted).  For me, these crashes<br>   usually occurred while making a different program from PROGMAN.EXE<br>   the default Windows shell, and vice-versa.  This is the reason<br>   SCSIHA.SYS may be necessary.<br><br>   I have absolutely no idea if SCSIHA.SYS is necessary with versions of<br>   ASPI4DOS earlier than 3.0.<br><br>   Note that many people can use ASPI4DOS 3.0 or 3.0a without<br>   SCSIHA.SYS; they do not seem to have any problems at all.  I consider<br>   these people lucky.  Others, like me, have had all sorts of problems.<br><br>3. In my opinion, the best, but not necessarily the easiest, solution is<br>   to upgrade to ASPI4DOS 3.1.  The SCSIHA.SYS driver is no longer<br>   needed.  Unfortunately, while you could get previous ASPI4DOS<br>   upgrades from the Adaptec BBS, the ASPI4DOS 3.1 driver is not<br>   available from the Adaptec BBS.  As far as I know, there are only<br>   three ways to get a copy:<br><br>      * You can buy the new (as of November 1992) Adaptec EZ SCSI driver<br> kit, which supposedly includes ASPI4DOS 3.1 as well as other<br> drivers, such as CDROM drivers.  I believe the list price is<br> around $75.<br><br>      * If you already have a copy of an older version of ASPI4DOS, you<br> can supposedly contact Adaptec to upgrade it to EZ SCSI for<br> around $30.<br><br>      * A copy of ASPI4DOS 3.1 is included in Central Point PC Tools 8.0<br> for MSDOS.  Note that the documentation and driver are stored in<br> different directories.  Note further that only ASPI4DOS is<br> included; the CDROM drivers and drivers to support more than two<br> hard disks are not included.  This is where I obtained my copy<br> of ASPI4DOS 3.1.<br><br>Note, however, that I am now getting occasional parity errors with<br>Windows.  In all probability, defective hardware in my PC is causing<br>this, as I upgraded my motherboard just after I found the above<br>solutions.  However, because these parity errors occur only during disk<br>accesses, there is a very small, but definite, possibility that the<br>parity errors are driver-related (for example, changing the bus on/off<br>timing for certain disk transfers might cause this).  I've run various<br>memory tests for hours at a time, and these tests have found no<br>problems.  This problem is probably caused by memory with marginal<br>timing requirements, which cause parity errors during disk transfers<br>(this is why the memory tests didn't find any problems -- the problems<br>show up only under disk I/O).  However, I'm mentioning this just in case<br>it isn't a hardware problem.<br><br><br>***** Floppy-controller-based tape backup devices:<br><br>     There are two possible problems with using the Adaptec 1542 with a<br>floppy-controller-based tape backup device, such as the Colorado Memory<br>Systems Jumbo 250:<br><br>1. Tape backups/restores can take a very long time.  The tape drive<br>   constantly starts, stops, starts, stops, etc.<br><br>2. Tape operations may be erratic, or encounter too many tape errors.<br>   (This problem might be caused by defective hardware on my 1542.<br>   However, I've heard of other people having similar problems, and so<br>   I'm mentioning this just in case it is not a hardware problem on my<br>   1542.)<br><br><br>* Tape backups/restores take a long time:<br><br>     If you have a floppy-controller-based tape backup device, you may<br>have to adjust the Adaptec 1540/1542 ""bus on/off timing"" for best<br>results when using the tape drive.  Normally, while doing a tape backup<br>or restore, the tape drive motor should be continuously running, with<br>only an occasional pause.  However, the default bus timing on the<br>Adaptec 1540/1542 may cause the tape drive motor to start and stop,<br>start and stop, every few seconds.  This causes needless wear to the<br>tape and tape drive (however, note that a dirty tape head or a defective<br>tape drive can also cause this -- make sure your tape heads are clean).<br>This also causes the tape backup or restore to take much, much longer<br>than necessary.<br><br>     The problem here is that these tape backups use the floppy DMA to<br>transfer data in memory to/from the tape drive, and the Adaptec uses DMA<br>to transfer data in memory to/from the hard disk.  The floppy DMA needs<br>to feed data to the tape drive at a certain rate; if the tape drive is<br>not fed data quickly enough by the floppy DMA, the tape drive stops,<br>rewinds a bit, and restarts (once enough data is eventually fed to it).<br>The default bus timing on the Adaptec (which is really DMA timing) is<br>""too large"".  For example, when a backup is done, data has to be<br>transferred from a hard disk to memory, and then from memory to the<br>tape.  Because the default timing on the Adaptec ""hogs"" the memory too<br>much (too much time is spent transferring data from a hard disk to<br>memory), not enough time is spent transferring data from memory to the<br>tape drive.  As a result, the tape drive constantly starts and stops,<br>because data is not fed to it quickly enough.<br><br>     The solution is to change the Adaptec's bus on/off timing.  The<br>default factory setting is 11 microseconds on, and 5 microseconds off.<br>The ""bus on"" timing needs to be lowered to 2-4 microseconds.  This can<br>be done in one of two ways:<br><br>* If you have ASPI4DOS, you can use the ""/n"" option.  For example, I use<br>  a ""bus on"" timing of 4 microseconds, which means that I use the<br>  following line in my CONFIG.SYS file:<br><br> DEVICE=c:\aspi4dos.sys /n4<br><br>  Note that there is NO space between the ""/n"" and the ""4"".<br><br>* If you don't have ASPI4DOS, your only recourse is to try to find a<br>  program called ""SETSCSI.EXE"", which is very difficult to find.  The<br>  reason is that Adaptec, for reasons of their own, does not seem to<br>  want this widely distributed.  I once asked someone who worked for<br>  Adaptec, and they asked me to not upload it anywhere.  If you have<br>  anonymous ftp access to the Internet, you could try using archie to<br>  hunt down a copy; I believe that there are a couple of sites that have<br>  it.  If you do find a copy, you run it like so:<br><br> setscsi -n:4<br><br>  This adjusts the ""bus on"" timing to 4 microseconds.  Running<br>  SETSCSI.EXE without any arguments resets the bus timing back to the<br>  factory defaults.<br><br>  Note that it seems that you cannot use SETSCSI.EXE if you use<br>  ASPI4DOS; SETSCSI.EXE crashed my system if ASPI4DOS was loaded.  I<br>  could use SETSCSI.EXE with SCSIHA.SYS, however.<br><br>Do not lower the ""bus on"" timing below 2 microseconds, or increase it<br>above 11 microseconds.  If you lower it too low, the hard disk<br>throughput will suddenly drop; your system will feel slower.  For me, 4<br>microseconds works fine.  This value may work fine for you, or you may<br>have to adjust it downwards a little.<br><br>     Once you've lowered the ""bus on"" timing, tape backups and restores<br>should run faster.<br><br>     Also, do not experiment with the bus on/off times (with the other<br>options that I have intentionally not described), unless you know what<br>you are doing.  Bad combinations can cause parity errors and worse, by<br>starving memory refresh.<br><br>     A program called BUSTIFIX.EXE exists on the Adaptec BBS.  Unless<br>this has been upgraded since I last checked (which has been a while),<br>this is a self-extracting archive containing a batch file and a couple<br>of other files.  This batch file was supposed to allow one to set the<br>bus on/off times for the 1540/1542 and others.  However, when I tried<br>running this program with my 1542A, my system crashed.  At the time, I<br>was running SCSIHA.SYS, and I didn't check to see if there was a<br>conflict with it.  Maybe this old program works only with the 1542B,<br>although the docs say that it works with the 1542A?<br><br><br>* Erratic tape operations or too many tape errors:<br><br>     This ""problem"" may or may not exist.  Although it existed on my<br>system, a hardware problem just on my particular 1542 could cause it.<br>However, I've heard of other people having similar problems, and so I'm<br>mentioning this just in case it isn't a hardware problem just on my<br>1542.<br><br>     Symptoms of this ""problem"", which persists even after cleaning the<br>tape head:<br><br>1. Backing up to tape encounters ""unusable sector detected"" errors,<br>   resulting in an aborted tape backup.<br><br>2. Tape backup works, but the tape compare fails.<br><br>3. The tape drive starts, stops, starts, stops, etc. much too often.<br>   Unlike the above-mentioned problem (""Tape backups/restores take a<br>   long time""), where the tape drive starts and stops every few seconds,<br>   this kind of starting/stopping occurs every few 10-20 seconds or so.<br><br>4. Fastback Plus 3.1 does not find/see any tape backup devices.  Other<br>   programs, like Central Point Backup and the CMS Jumbo software<br>   (assuming that you have a CMS Jumbo 250 tape drive) can find/see the<br>   tape drive, but Fastback Plus 3.1 cannot.<br><br>5. Too many tape read errors.<br><br>     Although I do not know what is causing this problem, I discovered<br>that using a different floppy controller solves it.  A few months ago, I<br>upgraded my motherboard, which contained an integrated floppy<br>controller.  As I already had a floppy controller on the 1542, I<br>initially disabled the motherboard floppy controller.  After a while, I<br>decided to try disabling the 1542 floppy controller and using the one on<br>the motherboard.  When I did this, the tape drive (a CMS Jumbo 250)<br>reliability increased dramatically, and Fastback Plus 3.1 was suddenly<br>able to find and use the tape drive.<br><br>     I don't know if this was caused by a hardware problem on my 1542.<br>On the one hand, the floppy drives worked great when they were attached<br>to the 1542, which seems to say that there was nothing wrong with the<br>1542.  On the other hand, the tape drive didn't work well attached to<br>the 1542 floppy controller, but it did work when attached to a different<br>controller; this could be an indication of a hardware problem on my<br>1542.  I did change floppy drive cables, and so it is conceivable that<br>the problem was in the cables.  I don't know what the cause really is;<br>however, if you're having similar problems, you might want to consider<br>trying a new floppy controller.<br><br><br>***** Sound cards:<br><br>     Many popular sound cards can play or record digitized sound, and<br>this is typically done using DMA.  Like the tape drive DMA, the<br>Adaptec's DMA can conflict with the sound card DMA.  Unlike that of the<br>tape DMA, this ""conflict"" usually manifests itself as a parity error<br>(your system crashes with a parity error message).  What happens is<br>that, data is being transferred so quickly by the sound card and the<br>Adaptec, memory refresh cannot occur quickly enough, which causes a<br>parity error.  Usually, getting a parity error means that there is a<br>hardware problem with your system; in this case, however, the parity<br>error is not a symptom of bad hardware.<br><br>     I've found that such parity errors typically occur while recording<br>digitized sound, and the chances of such errors increase as you increase<br>the recording fidelity (e.g., higher sampling rate, recording in stereo,<br>recording using 16-bits instead of 8, etc.).<br><br>     Like the tape drive solution, the solution here is to lower the<br>Adaptec's ""bus on"" timing.  See the section on tape drives for<br>information on how this is done.  Note, however, that this may or may<br>not solve the problem; it may only reduce the probability of a parity<br>error.  The software used to record digitized sound can greatly affect<br>this problem (i.e., some software is inefficient).  Disk caches, the<br>speed of your hard disk, and the amount of disk fragmentation can also<br>affect this.<br><br><br>***** Miscellaneous info:<br><br>     This section contains miscellaneous hints, tips, and rumors.  Much<br>of it is merely information that I've heard or read about, and have not<br>verified.  I believe that the following information is correct, but I'm<br>not sure.  Use it at your own risk.<br><br>* With QEMM 6.00, 6.01, and 6.02, you need to specify the ""DB=""<br>  parameter (e.g., ""DB=2""), unless you are using the ASPI4DOS driver.<br>  If you don't, QEMM will crash/hang at bootup.  Although the QEMM<br>  manual mentions this, the install program does not seem to detect that<br>  a 1542 is present and automatically add this option to the QEMM<br>  command line (at least, this occurred with the QEMM 6.00 install<br>  program -- I haven't tested any other version).  Earlier versions of<br>  QEMM probably need this parameter, but I'm not sure (I've never used a<br>  version earlier than 6.00).<br><br>  If you use ASPI4DOS, you do not need to give QEMM the ""DB="" parameter.<br><br>* Some or all versions of the 1542 do not support hard disks over one<br>  gigabyte in size.  To support hard disks with capacities over 1GB, you<br>  need to get a new ROM BIOS from Adaptec.  I'm not sure if this is<br>  still true of the latest 1542Bs being sold by Adaptec.<br><br>* To connect a CDROM drive to the 1542, you need a SCSI CDROM drive and<br>  some drivers.  Note that some CDROM drives have proprietary interfaces<br>  (non-SCSI); these drives cannot be used with the 1542.  You have three<br>  choices for CDROM drivers (I have no idea how well the following<br>  solutions work, or even if they work -- the following is secondhand<br>  information):<br><br>     1. You can buy Adaptec's EZ SCSI driver package, which lists for<br> something like $75.  If you already have older Adaptec drivers,<br> you can supposedly upgrade to EZ SCSI for around $30.  Contact<br> Adaptec for details.  The EZ SCSI package supposedly contains<br> everything that you need.<br><br>     2. You can buy the CorelSCSI! driver package, which is made by the<br> same people that make CorelDRAW!  This package contains CDROM<br> drivers, SCSI tape drivers, WORM drivers, etc.  I do not know<br> the list price, but I've seen this package sold for around<br> $80-$90.  Note that CorelSCSI! does not come with the ASPI4DOS<br> driver, which is needed.  If you do not already have ASPI4DOS,<br> you may be better off getting Adaptec's EZ SCSI instead.<br><br>     3. [This method is obsolete, as the following drivers have been<br> obsoleted by Adaptec's EZ SCSI kit, but I'm mentioning it in<br> case someone already has these drivers.]  You can use the<br> drivers in the Adaptec ASW-1410 kit (ASPI4DOS) and the ASW-410<br> kit (ASPI CDROM drivers).  You will have to get a copy of<br> MSCDEX.EXE (a high-level CDROM driver), if it is not included in<br> the ASW-410 kit, but this is available from several bulletin<br> boards.<br><br>* To use a SCSI tape drive with the 1542, you need software that knows<br>  how to talk to a SCSI tape drive.  Software that I've heard about are<br>  (again, like the above section on CDROM drives, I have no idea how<br>  well the following solutions work, or even if they work -- the<br>  following is secondhand information):<br><br>     1. Central Point PC Tools 8.0 for MSDOS supposedly supports a large<br> number of SCSI tape drives.  It comes with SCSI drivers<br> (ASPI4DOS 3.1) as well as Central Point Backup.<br><br>     2. The CorelSCSI! driver package contains a SCSI tape backup<br> program (see the above section on CDROM drives for more<br> details).  However, note that CorelSCSI! does not come with, but<br> requires, ASPI4DOS.<br><br>* I've seen advertisements that sell the 1542 in three configurations:<br><br>     1. 1542 SCSI controller with hard disk ROM BIOS.<br>     2. 1542 SCSI controller w/BIOS and Adaptec ASPI drivers.<br>     3. 1542 SCSI controller w/BIOS, Adaptec ASPI drivers, and<br> CorelSCSI! drivers/programs.<br><br>  I imagine that Adaptec now sells the 1542 in a fourth configuration:<br><br>     4. 1542 SCSI controller w/BIOS and EZ SCSI drivers (including ASPI<br> drivers).<br><br>* Those people who use Unix might be interested in a version of GNU tar<br>  for MSDOS that talks to a SCSI tape drive via the ASPI4DOS driver (you<br>  need this driver before you can use this program).  I've never used<br>  this version of GNU tar, but I've heard that it works (I don't know<br>  how well, though).  If you have anonymous ftp access to the Internet,<br>  a copy can be found on wsmr-simtel20.army.mil and mirror sites:<br><br> PD1:<MSDOS.DSKUTL><br> ASPIBIN.ZIP  67841 920131 Gnu Tar for SCSI tape drives, Adaptec 154xx<br> ASPIPAT.ZIP  21206 920131 Patches for ASPIBIN relative to Gnu Tar 1.10<br> ASPISRC.ZIP 221370 920131 Src for Gnu Tar for SCSI tape, Adaptec ctrlr<br><br>  I have no idea if a copy can be found on Compuserve; UNIXFORUM might<br>  have it, if any forum does.<br><br>* As far as MSDOS is concerned, the 1542A and the 1542B controllers are<br>  the same; with MSDOS, the 1542A should work as well as the 1542B.<br>  However, the hardware for these two boards is not 100% identical, and<br>  there is at least one (NON-MSDOS) program that initially did not work<br>  with a 1542A, but did work with a 1542B (BSD386 -- a 386 version of<br>  BSD Unix).<br><br>* In case anyone's curious, here's an edited copy of my CONFIG.SYS file:<br><br> FILES=40<br> BUFFERS=40<br> BREAK=ON<br> STACKS=10,256<br> DEVICE=c:\sys\dev\aspi4dos.sys /d /n4<br> DEVICE=C:\QEMM\QEMM386.SYS on RAM ROM DMA=32 ST:M X=F800-FFFF<br> DOS=HIGH,UMB<br> DEVICEHIGH=c:\sys\dev\nnansi.sys<br> DEVICEHIGH=C:\DOS\SETVER.EXE<br> shell = c:\dos\command.com /p<br><br>  Note that I'm using QEMM and ASPI4DOS 3.1.  If I were using ASPI4DOS<br>  3.0 or 3.0a, I'd probably have to use a CONFIG.SYS that looked like:<br><br> FILES=40<br> BUFFERS=40<br> BREAK=ON<br> STACKS=10,256<br> DEVICE=c:\sys\dev\aspi4dos.sys /d /n4<br> DEVICE=C:\QEMM\QEMM386.SYS on RAM ROM DMA=32 ST:M X=F800-FFFF<br> DOS=HIGH,UMB<br> DEVICEHIGH=c:\sys\dev\scsiha.sys /V386<br> DEVICEHIGH=c:\sys\dev\nnansi.sys<br> DEVICEHIGH=C:\DOS\SETVER.EXE<br> shell = c:\dos\command.com /p<br><br>  If I weren't using ASPI4DOS, I'd probably use something that looked<br>  like:<br><br> FILES=40<br> BUFFERS=40<br> BREAK=ON<br> STACKS=10,256<br> DEVICE=c:\sys\dev\scsiha.sys /V386<br> DEVICE=C:\QEMM\QEMM386.SYS on RAM ROM DB=32 DMA=32 ST:M X=F800-FFFF<br> DOS=HIGH,UMB<br> DEVICEHIGH=c:\sys\dev\nnansi.sys<br> DEVICEHIGH=C:\DOS\SETVER.EXE<br> shell = c:\dos\command.com /p<br><br>  However, if I used a floppy-controller-based tape drive, or if I<br>  planned to record high-quality sound from a sound card, I would still<br>  need some way of changing the Adaptec's bus on/off times.  The first<br>  two versions of CONFIG.SYS take care of this, but this last version<br>  doesn't.<br><br>"

There is always the possibility that the<br>settings may destroy your hardware!<br>!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br><br><br>Since I hope however that only well-minded people undergo the effort of<br>posting their settings the chance of applicability exists. If you should<br>agree or disagree with some setting, let me know immediately in order<br>to update the list.<br><br>If you possess a HD not mentioned here of which you know BIOS and/or<br>jumper settings, please mail them to me for the next update of the list!<br><br>Only IDE (AT-Bus) Harddisks will be accounted for.<br>If not specified the Landing Zone should be set equal to the number of<br>cylinders. If not specified the 'Write Precompensation' should be set<br>65535. (There are BIOSes that don't even ask for it).<br><br>Another statement (maybe right):<br>IDE harddisk don't have Precomp and LZone. The precomp is a built-in parameter<br>and lzone isn't used because most if not every IDE disk has autopark.<br><br>The jumpers' names are given as printed on the HD's board, often only a<br>jumper number (JP12 means the jumper '12'). A zero means that the jumper<br>is left open, a one means that the jumper is closed.<br><br><br><br>***************************   C O N N E R   ***************************<br><br><br>  Conner Peripherals Drive Geometry<br><br>IDE/AT<br><br>Conner drives are low level formatted at the factory.

This is due to the protocal the takes place between the two drives <br>when performing diagnostics.<br>   There are four links, LK1, LK2, LK4 and LK5, adjacent to the 40 way <br>interface connector. They have the following functions and are described <br>in order as viewed from the end of the drive, with the first jumper <br>described nearest the 40 way interface connector.<br><br>LK2: LED <br>     When fitted, this jumper connects the LED drive to pin 39 of the<br>     interface. This allows a LED to be connected to the interface. An<br>     external current limiting resistor needs to be fitted in series with<br>     the LED when this option is selected. The value of the resistor will<br>     be dependant on the LED type chosen but will be in the range of 130<br>     Ohms ot 220 Ohms.<br><br>LK1: Dual Drives<br>     This jumper must be fitted when two drives are attached to a single<br>     bus. It fallows communication across the 40 way interface connector,<br>     indicating, to the Master drive, the presence of a Slave.<br><br>LK4: Master<br>     When fitted this signifies that the drive jumpered is a Master. If<br>     there are two drives connected on a single bus then only one may be<br>     jumpered in this way.<br><br>LK5: IOChRdy<br>     When fitted this connects the IOChRdy signal to the drive, it is <br>     fitted when the drive is used in host systems that have a higher<br>     data transfer rate than the drive i.e. greater than 4 MBytes per<br>     second when using 1:1 interleave. This jumper is not normally <br>     fitted as most hosts transfer at a lower rate than 4 MBytes per<br>     second.<br><br>   There are four possible Master/Slave configurations in which a drive(s)<br>may be jumpered:<br><br>     Master, single drive with LED on interface  LK2 & LK4 fitted.<br>     Master, single drive without LED on interface LK4 only fitted.<br>     Master, dual drive without LED on interface LK4 & LK1 fitted.<br>     Slave, dual drive without LED on interface  No jumpers fitted.<br>     Master, dual drive with LED on interface  LK4, LK1 & LK2 fitted.<br>     Slave, dual drive with LED on interface  LK2 only fitted.<br><br>   The Master drive will delay power-up for approximately two seconds to<br>reduce power surges in applications where dual drives are used.<br><br>   The other connections for a LED will be found close to the 28 way <br>connector at the other end of the drive. This LED driver is not affected<br>by the link options. An internal current limiting resistor is on the <br>drive for this LED driver.

This is due to the protocal the takes place between the two drives <br>when performing diagnostics.<br>   There are four links, LK1, LK2, LK4 and LK5, adjacent to the 40 way <br>interface connector. They have the following functions and are described <br>in order as viewed from the end of the drive, with the first jumper <br>described nearest the 40 way interface connector.<br><br>LK2: LED <br>     When fitted, this jumper connects the LED drive to pin 39 of the<br>     interface. This allows a LED to be connected to the interface. An<br>     external current limiting resistor needs to be fitted in series with<br>     the LED when this option is selected. The value of the resistor will<br>     be dependant on the LED type chosen but will be in the range of 130<br>     Ohms ot 220 Ohms.<br><br>LK1: Dual Drives<br>     This jumper must be fitted when two drives are attached to a single<br>     bus. It fallows communication across the 40 way interface connector,<br>     indicating, to the Master drive, the presence of a Slave.<br><br>LK4: Master<br>     When fitted this signifies that the drive jumpered is a Master. If<br>     there are two drives connected on a single bus then only one may be<br>     jumpered in this way.<br><br>LK5: IOChRdy<br>     When fitted this connects the IOChRdy signal to the drive, it is <br>     fitted when the drive is used in host systems that have a higher<br>     data transfer rate than the drive i.e. greater than 4 MBytes per<br>     second when using 1:1 interleave. This jumper is not normally <br>     fitted as most hosts transfer at a lower rate than 4 MBytes per<br>     second.<br><br>   There are four possible Master/Slave configurations in which a drive(s)<br>may be jumpered:<br><br>     Master, single drive with LED on interface  LK2 & LK4 fitted.<br>     Master, single drive without LED on interface LK4 only fitted.<br>     Master, dual drive without LED on interface LK4 & LK1 fitted.<br>     Slave, dual drive without LED on interface  No jumpers fitted.<br>     Master, dual drive with LED on interface  LK4, LK1 & LK2 fitted.<br>     Slave, dual drive with LED on interface  LK2 only fitted.<br><br>   The Master drive will delay power-up for approximately two seconds to<br>reduce power surges in applications where dual drives are used.<br><br>   The other connections for a LED will be found close to the 28 way <br>connector at the other end of the drive. This LED driver is not affected<br>by the link options. An internal current limiting resistor is on the <br>drive for this LED driver.

597	0	"Since running any GUI over a network is going to slow it down by a<br>fair amount, I expect Windows NT will be multiuser only in the sense<br>of sharing filesystems.

For maximum compatiblity with the software which<br>   will be used to create the WSM .HLP file (Stefan Olson's Help Writer's<br>   Assistant for Windows), please save the bitmaps with Windows Paintbrush or<br>   WinGIF. <br><br>3. Include a 16-color .BMP of the program's icon (.ICO file).  Many programs<br>   are available to convert .ICO to .BMP format, or Windows Paintbrush may be<br>   used.  The .BMP will be embedded in the summary text.<br><br>4. Double-check for spelling errors, formatting corrections, etc.  <br><br>5. Compress the .TXT file, the .BMP of the program icon, and any additional<br>   .BMPs into a single file using PKZIP (any version).<br><br>6. Submit the entry by UUENCODING the .ZIPfile, and e-mailing it to:<br>   <br>   DAA7365@TAMUTS.TAMU.EDU<br><br>   if submitting via the Internet or Compuserve. If submitting via America<br>   Online, send a brief message indicating submission, and append the .ZIP<br>   file, then e-mail to:<br><br>   DiegoAA<br><br>7. If any changes are required, or a new version is released, complete<br>   the above procedures again.  Send all submissions to the @TAMUTS address,<br>   and any comments, suggestions, criticisms, to DAA7365@RIGEL.TAMU.EDU.<br><br>All entries received before the deadline will be included in the subsequent<br>edition of WSM.  The editor will not be held responsible for any errors, and<br>we reserve the right to make changes to the entries.<br><br>WSM is not limited to shareware/freeware software.  A special area will be<br>devoted to commercially available Windows 3.x and NT software.  Commercial<br>software authors should follow the same steps above, with the exception of<br>the limitations on size - the .TXT file and .BMPs may be as large as required<br>(and as large as is practical for transmission over phone lines).  There<br>is no charge for the publishing of either shareware/freeware or commercial<br>product entries.  <br><br>Advertisements for computer hardware, software, bulletin boards, etc. may<br>be submitted as well. Again, the same procedures apply, with the exception of<br>the size limitations.  There is no charge for advertising space.  The first<br>ten advertisements submitted each month will be included; subsequent<br>submissions will not be included due to size constraints.<br><br>WSM is currently looking for persons willing to devote the time to author<br>columns within WSM.  A C/C++ programing section, a Visual Basic section, and<br>two Windows-specific opinion/advice columns are envisioned.  All work will<br>be on a voluntary basis.  If you wish to aid WSM and author a monthly column<br>on one of the above topics, please send us mail at DAA7365@TAMUTS.TAMU.EDU or<br>DiegoAA on America Online."

Edition 01 Apr 93<br><br>This article applies only to Windows 3.0 and 3.1, and not to NT, OS/2<br>or DOS apps not running under Windows.<br><br>One of the unadvertised limitations of most current Windows PCs is that<br>their RS-232C (serial, COM) performance is seriously deficient.  Almost<br>everyone who purchases a high-speed modem (V.32bis, V.32, PEP or HST)<br>discovers the problem the first time they try to download a file or accept<br>an incoming FAX (at 9600+) after upgrading the modem.  Overrun and retry<br>errors abound, even when the only active application is the datacomm or<br>FAX program.  If the transfer completes at all, it may take even longer<br>than with the old 2400bps modem.<br><br><br>There are three reasons for the problem:<br><br>1. The Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitters (UARTs) used in most<br>   PCs are primitive Ns8250 devices with single-byte FIFO buffers.  If the<br>   operating system/driver cannot read and flush each character at high<br>   interrupt rates, the next incoming character overwrites the FIFO and<br>   the previous one is lost.  DOS, being a fairly single-minded<br>   environment during datacomm, can usually keep up. Windows can't.<br><br>2. Windows has more operating system overhead than plain DOS, and<br>   interrupts often take longer to service.  Overruns are much more likely<br>   than under DOS.  As soon as you report to your PC/modem vendor that you<br>   are losing data, you may be advised that ""you need to upgrade to a<br>   16550"". More likely, since there seems to be a conspiracy of ignorance<br>   about this issue,  you'll get no useful advice at all.  Most of the<br>   store-front and mail-order sources I spoke with in attempting to solve<br>   my own problem had never heard the term ""16550"" and many didn't even<br>   know what a UART was.<br><br>3. Even your PC has Ns16550A UARTs (and PS/2's do), or if you can upgrade<br>   your mother/COM board or add a new COM board, you may STILL experience<br>   errors and overruns because the standard MicroSoft Windows COM drivers<br>   don't take full advantage of the 16550.  Windows 3.1 is improved in this<br>   regard over 3.0, but I still recommend a driver upgrade.  Applications<br>   like ProComm+/Win (which is what I use) cannot get around this problem<br>   by themselves.<br><br>If you have a modem CARD, you may not have a problem, as the modem part of<br>the card can be designed to be aware of the state of the UART, and avoid<br>overrunning it; however, I wouldn't want to bet that the card designers<br>were that clever, and will insist on a 16550 UART if I ever buy a modem<br>card.  Some modem cards don't even have conventional UARTs, but if they<br>are to work with standard Windows drivers, they need to simulate one.<br>Use MSD.EXE (below) to see what the modem card is, or is pretending to be.<br><br><br>The Hardware Situation.<br><br>The UARTs on most PC COM ports are based on National Semiconductor Ns8250<br>or Ns16450 chips (or megacells inside VLSI chips where you can't replace<br>them).  You can ID the UART type on your system by running the MicroSoft<br>diagnostic program \WINDOWS\MSD.EXE.  Be sure to run it in DOS *before*<br>bringing up Windows.   The Windows serial API may prevent MSD from<br>accurately identifying a 16550 if you run it from a Windows DOS prompt.<br><br>The Ns16550 UART has separate 16-byte transmit and receive FIFOs with<br>configurable trigger levels, and can run reliably at clock rates up to<br>460,800 bps, although with current modem technology, there's no point in<br>pushing your luck by going over 115,200 bps. The 16550 has shorted access<br>cycle times than the 16450 or 8250.  The 16550 also has DMA capability, but<br>it is not clear that any PC drivers ever use this.  For more technical info,<br>see National Semiconductor Application Note AN-491.<br><br>So, what UART component do you have?<br><br>Try to locate the UART on your mother board, multi-function I/O card, COM<br>board or ISA/MCA modem card.  If you can't find a socketed component with<br>the numbers ""8250"" or ""16450"", your COM ports are probably buried in VLSI,<br>and you won't be able to perform a chip replacement.  If you can DISABLE<br>your VLSI COM ports (as I chose to do), you can at least add an aftermarket<br>COM board.<br><br>If you have one or more socketed 8250 or 16450 chips, you can buy plug-in<br>Ns16550AFN or PC16C550CN (low power CMOS version) ICs from several<br>suppliers typically for $9 to $15 each.  The ""N"" chip is the normal 40-pin<br>dual-in-line package.  Other styles are available, but avoid any Ns16550<br>chips without the ""A"" (the 16C550C are presumably all OK).<br><br>Early Ns chips have bugs, although National will reportedly exchange those<br>of their own manufacture for free.  Clone chips are available from various<br>IC makers other than National.  The manual for the TurboCom drivers states<br>support for the following (apparently equivalent) chips:<br>National Semiconductor: 16550A, 16551, 16552<br>Chips&Technology:       82C607<br>Texas Instruments:      t16c550a<br>Silicon Systems:        73M550<br>VLSI                    16C550<br>TurboCom warns about the pre-""A"" Ns16550 and Western Digital 16C550,<br>says that problems have been reported with early IBM PS/2 55SX and 70<br>systems (IBM reportedly will upgrade them).<br><br>If you DON'T have socketed 8250/16450 chips, you'll need to buy an after-<br>market COM or multi-function board. If this is a modem card situation, you<br>may be hosed. To add a new COM or multi-function card, you'll need to<br>either disable the COM1/2 port(s) you are replacing, or re-assign them to<br>COM3/4 (although watch out for IRQ conflicts without TurboCom).<br><br>Although cheaper cards are available, in the interest of getting the<br>problem solved quickly I elected buy the Modular Circuit Technology<br>MCT-AIO+ card from:<br><br>JDR Microdevices<br>2233 Samaritan Drive<br>San Jose  CA  95124<br>(800) 538-5000 voice US<br>(408) 559-1200 voice other<br>(800) 538-5005 FAX US<br><br>The MCT-AIO+ (and the ""+"" is important) sells for $89.95.

The standard MS serial drivers don't take full advantage of the<br>16550. The Windows 3.0 drivers are even less capable, and the Windows 3.1<br>drivers have the following limitations:<br> - They enable only the receive FIFO, and only at rates above 2400 bps.<br> - They never enable the transmit FIFO, which  results in an interrupt<br>   rate of 10x during uploads.<br> - They set the trigger level at 14 bytes (too high - it's easy for 2<br>   more bytes to arrive before the driver can read the FIFO).<br> - The Ports menu of the Control Panel only allows speeds up to 19200.<br>   With a V.32bis modem,  sparse data and text can easily compress 3:1<br>   or more, suggesting that a host DTE connect rate of 57,600 bps would<br>   be effective.<br> - The API won't accept rates above ""CBR_128000"".<br> - The API won't let DOS programs know there is a 16550 there, and even<br>   if it did, DOS programs that aren't 16550-aware get little benefit<br>   from a 16550 port with the standard drivers.<br> - They don't allow IRQ sharing for COM3,4.<br> - The BIOS doesn't initialize COM3,4 properly in many systems.<br> - Windows provides no workaround for apps that don't provide port<br>   speed options above 19200 bps.<br><br>These problems are reportedly NOT solved in Windows NT or DOS 6.0, and may<br>or may not be addressed in any Windows releases after 3.1 (but before 4.0).<br>Rumors suggest they ""may"" be solved in Windows ""4.0"".<br><br>You can get replacement drivers that solve all of those problems by buying<br>a copy of ""TurboCom"", current version 1.2, from:<br><br>Bio-Engineering Research<br>Pacific CommWare Division<br>180 Beacon Hill Lane<br>Ashland  OR   97520-9701<br>(503) 482-2744 voice<br>(503) 482-2627 FAX<br>(503) 482-2633 BBS<br>MCImail:    344-5374<br>CompuServe: 71521,760<br><br>Price was around $50 as I recall.  Bio-Eng is not set up to accept credit<br>cards, so I had to send a check.  Egghead and 1-800-Software list TurboCom<br>but as far as I know, they don't stock it.  Bio is not a software company<br>per se.  They apparently needed reliable hi-speed serial connections for<br>an in-house instrument application, wrote their own driver, discovered a<br>market for it, revised it to be a general purpose COM driver suite. They<br>recently upgraded it for Windows 3.1.  It is run-time licensed.<br><br>I now have my host (DTE) connect rate set to 57,600 bps most of  my<br>datacomm apps, and I am having ZERO problems with downloads. I routinely<br>see transfer rates that exceed 2,000 bps. I am also using 115,200 bps<br>when linking an HP95LX to my PC, with lossless bi-directional I/O.<br>Uploads to various remote systems are another matter, because many hosts<br>are still using antique UARTs and drivers.<br><br>Note that 19200 is still the highest rate that the Windows 3.1 Port menu<br>in Control Panel will allow in configuring a COM port.  TurboCom gets<br>around this by allowing you to specify, on each port, a factor that will<br>set the real UART rate to a multiple of the rate passed through the<br>Windows APIs and dialog boxes.<br><br>I also have CTS/RTS hardware flow control enabled, and I suggest that you<br>do the same.  Even if you only ever transfer 7-bit ASCII data, Xon/XOff is<br>not a sufficiently reliable method of flow control.  The informal (DEC)<br>standard for Xon/Xoff hysteresis is that the sender may transmit another<br>16 (yes, sixteen) bytes after receipt of the Xoff from the receiving<br>system or device.  The 16 byte FIFO in the 16550 is clearly not big enough<br>to let us rely exclusively on Xon/Xoff.  A well-respected datacomm<br>engineer has informed me that the 16550's can't really do CTS/RTS all<br>by itself in the DOS/Windows environment, so using data rates above<br>115,200 may still be risky.<br><br>Even with hardware flow control, a 16550 with TurboCom can still<br>experience overruns in very busy systems, with lots of apps running and<br>serious swapping in progress. If this is your situation, you may need to<br>buy a co-processed COM board, but this will cost you more than a<br>16550/TurboCom upgrade.  A review of two such boards, and a review of<br>TurboCom, can be found in the Feb'93 issue of ""Windows Sources"" magazine.<br>I suggest trying a 16550/TurboCom upgrade first, and experiment with<br>process priorities and time slices if you are a ""power user"" whose<br>thrashing system still runs into comm problems.<br><br><br>Closing Soapbox Comments<br><br>The state of RS-232C serial datacomm support is an embarrassment across<br>the computer industry.  Because it is the oldest standard I/O interface,<br>the job of designing hardware and writing software often seems to be<br>assigned to the least senior or lowest ranked engineers at computer<br>companies.  The design of the average serial port is at least ten years<br>behind the state of the art. In my last job, with a major workstation<br>vendor, I lobbied for improved serial ports when they were doing the<br>initial designs of a new system.  That family of machines was<br>subsequently introduced with 16550 ports.  However, this is the<br>exception.

"re: What to do after the high speed modem arrives.       Edition 01 Apr 93<br><br>This article applies only to Windows 3.0 and 3.1, and not to NT, OS/2<br>or DOS apps not running under Windows.<br><br>One of the unadvertised limitations of most current Windows PCs is that<br>their RS-232C (serial, COM) performance is seriously deficient.  Almost<br>everyone who purchases a high-speed modem (V.32bis, V.32, PEP or HST)<br>discovers the problem the first time they try to download a file or accept<br>an incoming FAX (at 9600+) after upgrading the modem.  Overrun and retry<br>errors abound, even when the only active application is the datacomm or<br>FAX program.  If the transfer completes at all, it may take even longer<br>than with the old 2400bps modem.<br><br><br>There are three reasons for the problem:<br><br>1. The Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitters (UARTs) used in most<br>   PCs are primitive Ns8250 devices with single-byte FIFO buffers.  If the<br>   operating system/driver cannot read and flush each character at high<br>   interrupt rates, the next incoming character overwrites the FIFO and<br>   the previous one is lost.  DOS, being a fairly single-minded<br>   environment during datacomm, can usually keep up. Windows can't.<br><br>2. Windows has more operating system overhead than plain DOS, and<br>   interrupts often take longer to service.  Overruns are much more likely<br>   than under DOS.  As soon as you report to your PC/modem vendor that you<br>   are losing data, you may be advised that ""you need to upgrade to a<br>   16550"". More likely, since there seems to be a conspiracy of ignorance<br>   about this issue,  you'll get no useful advice at all.  Most of the<br>   store-front and mail-order sources I spoke with in attempting to solve<br>   my own problem had never heard the term ""16550"" and many didn't even<br>   know what a UART was.<br><br>3. Even your PC has Ns16550A UARTs (and PS/2's do), or if you can upgrade<br>   your mother/COM board or add a new COM board, you may STILL experience<br>   errors and overruns because the standard MicroSoft Windows COM drivers<br>   don't take full advantage of the 16550.  Windows 3.1 is improved in this<br>   regard over 3.0, but I still recommend a driver upgrade.  Applications<br>   like ProComm+/Win (which is what I use) cannot get around this problem<br>   by themselves.<br><br>If you have a modem CARD, you may not have a problem, as the modem part of<br>the card can be designed to be aware of the state of the UART, and avoid<br>overrunning it; however, I wouldn't want to bet that the card designers<br>were that clever, and will insist on a 16550 UART if I ever buy a modem<br>card.  Some modem cards don't even have conventional UARTs, but if they<br>are to work with standard Windows drivers, they need to simulate one.<br>Use MSD.EXE (below) to see what the modem card is, or is pretending to be.<br><br><br>The Hardware Situation.<br><br>The UARTs on most PC COM ports are based on National Semiconductor Ns8250<br>or Ns16450 chips (or megacells inside VLSI chips where you can't replace<br>them).  You can ID the UART type on your system by running the MicroSoft<br>diagnostic program \WINDOWS\MSD.EXE.  Be sure to run it in DOS *before*<br>bringing up Windows.   The Windows serial API may prevent MSD from<br>accurately identifying a 16550 if you run it from a Windows DOS prompt.<br><br>The Ns16550 UART has separate 16-byte transmit and receive FIFOs with<br>configurable trigger levels, and can run reliably at clock rates up to<br>460,800 bps, although with current modem technology, there's no point in<br>pushing your luck by going over 115,200 bps. The 16550 has shorted access<br>cycle times than the 16450 or 8250.  The 16550 also has DMA capability, but<br>it is not clear that any PC drivers ever use this.  For more technical info,<br>see National Semiconductor Application Note AN-491.<br><br>So, what UART component do you have?<br><br>Try to locate the UART on your mother board, multi-function I/O card, COM<br>board or ISA/MCA modem card.  If you can't find a socketed component with<br>the numbers ""8250"" or ""16450"", your COM ports are probably buried in VLSI,<br>and you won't be able to perform a chip replacement.  If you can DISABLE<br>your VLSI COM ports (as I chose to do), you can at least add an aftermarket<br>COM board.<br><br>If you have one or more socketed 8250 or 16450 chips, you can buy plug-in<br>Ns16550AFN or PC16C550CN (low power CMOS version) ICs from several<br>suppliers typically for $9 to $15 each.  The ""N"" chip is the normal 40-pin<br>dual-in-line package.  Other styles are available, but avoid any Ns16550<br>chips without the ""A"" (the 16C550C are presumably all OK).<br><br>Early Ns chips have bugs, although National will reportedly exchange those<br>of their own manufacture for free.  Clone chips are available from various<br>IC makers other than National.  The manual for the TurboCom drivers states<br>support for the following (apparently equivalent) chips:<br>National Semiconductor: 16550A, 16551, 16552<br>Chips&Technology:       82C607<br>Texas Instruments:      t16c550a<br>Silicon Systems:        73M550<br>VLSI                    16C550<br>TurboCom warns about the pre-""A"" Ns16550 and Western Digital 16C550,<br>says that problems have been reported with early IBM PS/2 55SX and 70<br>systems (IBM reportedly will upgrade them).<br><br>If you DON'T have socketed 8250/16450 chips, you'll need to buy an after-<br>market COM or multi-function board. If this is a modem card situation, you<br>may be hosed. To add a new COM or multi-function card, you'll need to<br>either disable the COM1/2 port(s) you are replacing, or re-assign them to<br>COM3/4 (although watch out for IRQ conflicts without TurboCom).<br><br>Although cheaper cards are available, in the interest of getting the<br>problem solved quickly I elected buy the Modular Circuit Technology<br>MCT-AIO+ card from:<br><br>JDR Microdevices<br>2233 Samaritan Drive<br>San Jose  CA  95124<br>(800) 538-5000 voice US<br>(408) 559-1200 voice other<br>(800) 538-5005 FAX US<br><br>The MCT-AIO+ (and the ""+"" is important) sells for $89.95.

The standard MS serial drivers don't take full advantage of the<br>16550. The Windows 3.0 drivers are even less capable, and the Windows 3.1<br>drivers have the following limitations:<br> - They enable only the receive FIFO, and only at rates above 2400 bps.<br> - They never enable the transmit FIFO, which  results in an interrupt<br>   rate of 10x during uploads.<br> - They set the trigger level at 14 bytes (too high - it's easy for 2<br>   more bytes to arrive before the driver can read the FIFO).<br> - The Ports menu of the Control Panel only allows speeds up to 19200.<br>   With a V.32bis modem,  sparse data and text can easily compress 3:1<br>   or more, suggesting that a host DTE connect rate of 57,600 bps would<br>   be effective.<br> - The API won't accept rates above ""CBR_128000"".<br> - The API won't let DOS programs know there is a 16550 there, and even<br>   if it did, DOS programs that aren't 16550-aware get little benefit<br>   from a 16550 port with the standard drivers.<br> - They don't allow IRQ sharing for COM3,4.<br> - The BIOS doesn't initialize COM3,4 properly in many systems.<br> - Windows provides no workaround for apps that don't provide port<br>   speed options above 19200 bps.<br><br>These problems are reportedly NOT solved in Windows NT or DOS 6.0, and may<br>or may not be addressed in any Windows releases after 3.1 (but before 4.0).<br>Rumors suggest they ""may"" be solved in Windows ""4.0"".<br><br>You can get replacement drivers that solve all of those problems by buying<br>a copy of ""TurboCom"", current version 1.2, from:<br><br>Bio-Engineering Research<br>Pacific CommWare Division<br>180 Beacon Hill Lane<br>Ashland  OR   97520-9701<br>(503) 482-2744 voice<br>(503) 482-2627 FAX<br>(503) 482-2633 BBS<br>MCImail:    344-5374<br>CompuServe: 71521,760<br><br>Price was around $50 as I recall.  Bio-Eng is not set up to accept credit<br>cards, so I had to send a check.  Egghead and 1-800-Software list TurboCom<br>but as far as I know, they don't stock it.  Bio is not a software company<br>per se.  They apparently needed reliable hi-speed serial connections for<br>an in-house instrument application, wrote their own driver, discovered a<br>market for it, revised it to be a general purpose COM driver suite. They<br>recently upgraded it for Windows 3.1.  It is run-time licensed.<br><br>I now have my host (DTE) connect rate set to 57,600 bps most of  my<br>datacomm apps, and I am having ZERO problems with downloads. I routinely<br>see transfer rates that exceed 2,000 bps. I am also using 115,200 bps<br>when linking an HP95LX to my PC, with lossless bi-directional I/O.<br>Uploads to various remote systems are another matter, because many hosts<br>are still using antique UARTs and drivers.<br><br>Note that 19200 is still the highest rate that the Windows 3.1 Port menu<br>in Control Panel will allow in configuring a COM port.  TurboCom gets<br>around this by allowing you to specify, on each port, a factor that will<br>set the real UART rate to a multiple of the rate passed through the<br>Windows APIs and dialog boxes.<br><br>I also have CTS/RTS hardware flow control enabled, and I suggest that you<br>do the same.  Even if you only ever transfer 7-bit ASCII data, Xon/XOff is<br>not a sufficiently reliable method of flow control.  The informal (DEC)<br>standard for Xon/Xoff hysteresis is that the sender may transmit another<br>16 (yes, sixteen) bytes after receipt of the Xoff from the receiving<br>system or device.  The 16 byte FIFO in the 16550 is clearly not big enough<br>to let us rely exclusively on Xon/Xoff.  A well-respected datacomm<br>engineer has informed me that the 16550's can't really do CTS/RTS all<br>by itself in the DOS/Windows environment, so using data rates above<br>115,200 may still be risky.<br><br>Even with hardware flow control, a 16550 with TurboCom can still<br>experience overruns in very busy systems, with lots of apps running and<br>serious swapping in progress. If this is your situation, you may need to<br>buy a co-processed COM board, but this will cost you more than a<br>16550/TurboCom upgrade.  A review of two such boards, and a review of<br>TurboCom, can be found in the Feb'93 issue of ""Windows Sources"" magazine.<br>I suggest trying a 16550/TurboCom upgrade first, and experiment with<br>process priorities and time slices if you are a ""power user"" whose<br>thrashing system still runs into comm problems.<br><br><br>Closing Soapbox Comments<br><br>The state of RS-232C serial datacomm support is an embarrassment across<br>the computer industry.  Because it is the oldest standard I/O interface,<br>the job of designing hardware and writing software often seems to be<br>assigned to the least senior or lowest ranked engineers at computer<br>companies.  The design of the average serial port is at least ten years<br>behind the state of the art. In my last job, with a major workstation<br>vendor, I lobbied for improved serial ports when they were doing the<br>initial designs of a new system.  That family of machines was<br>subsequently introduced with 16550 ports.  However, this is the<br>exception.

The VLB<br>   and EISA version should have no problems.<br> <br>b) I'm pretty sure from my experience that the ISA version doesn't<br>   work in systems with over 16M Ram.  There is supposed to be way<br>   of switching the ""memory aperture"" feature off to prevent this,<br>   but apparently it doesn't work.  I posted some ""help me"" messages<br>   on the net and people indicated that the EISA card didn't have this<br>   problem.<br><br>c) FALSE<br><br>d) The VLB card, which I have, allows you to set memory aperture over 32M<br>   by using their configuration software.  No messing with jumpers necessary.<br><br>   The 32M problem is probably valid only for ISA cards.<br><br><br><br>a) Again, the memory aperture need only be disabled if you have more than 124M RAM<br>   (EISA and VLB) or 12 M (ISA).  32M should not be a problem for you. <br> <br>b) Dunno.<br><br>c) Depends on the bus.

I can use 640x480 at 72hz, 24-bit and 800x600 at 70hz, 24-bit, all<br>   non-interlaced.<br><br>b) Yes - According to PC Magazine, they've tested a local bus version<br>   that does 1024x768 in 24-bit which may or may not be interlaced.<br><br>c) Not for the Pro. Sometimes for the Plus.<br><br>   Some modes may run only interlaced on certain monitors. This has nothing to <br>   do with 24 bits ... only with screen size. Note that for 24 bit color<br>   and Windows you MUST have 2 megs, memory size calculations notwithstanding.<br><br><br><br>a) They aren't perfect, but are much improved.  I don't recall the last time which<br>   I had to leave mach 32 mode (ATI GUP mode) and switch to 8514 or VGA mode due<br>   to software incompatibility.<br><br>b) True.  Many people recommended going back to Build 55 or 54.<br><br>c) They appear to be excellent, but have a few bugs. For example, certain<br>   graphs with dashed lines in Mathcad 3.1 do not print correctly, though they<br>   do display OK on the screen. They are about par for fancy cards ..<br>   other accelerated cards also have bugs.<br><br>d) Overall, I like the card, even if driver performance is somewhat less than<br>   satisfactory.  I am running the 1024*768 16 Color mode as that is all my<br>   NT driver for October NT version seems to allow.<br><br>   I will say this that Color performance is not quite as nice as a Diamond<br>   Stealth VRAM, but I have not been able to try out a lot of the options on<br>   the old driver.<br><br><br><br>a) It's quite fast, but whether or not its the fastest is open to debate.<br> <br>b) Yes - I'll admit it was very very fast in 16-bit mode, which is what<br>   I wanted to use it for.  Too bad it crashed (in many different ways)<br>   every 20 minutes or so...<br><br>c) Depends on many many things.<br><br><br><br>a) I like it.<br><br>b) Well - PC Magazine seems to think it is.<br><br>c) Yes, this appears to be true :-)<br><br>d) As to greatest thing since sliced bread, I doubt it.  Better cards are<br>   coming out.  Who knows, maybe ATI will come out with something faster yet.<br>   Several reviews I read rated one Pycon Winjet card as a superior performer <br>   at a cheaper price except for availability of drivers, which Pycon was <br>   developing at that time.

I don't recall the last time which<br>   I had to leave mach 32 mode (ATI GUP mode) and switch to 8514 or VGA mode due<br>   to software incompatibility.<br><br>b) True.  Many people recommended going back to Build 55 or 54.<br><br>c) They appear to be excellent, but have a few bugs. For example, certain<br>   graphs with dashed lines in Mathcad 3.1 do not print correctly, though they<br>   do display OK on the screen. They are about par for fancy cards ..<br>   other accelerated cards also have bugs.<br><br>d) Overall, I like the card, even if driver performance is somewhat less than<br>   satisfactory.  I am running the 1024*768 16 Color mode as that is all my<br>   NT driver for October NT version seems to allow.<br><br>   I will say this that Color performance is not quite as nice as a Diamond<br>   Stealth VRAM, but I have not been able to try out a lot of the options on<br>   the old driver.<br><br><br><br>a) It's quite fast, but whether or not its the fastest is open to debate.<br> <br>b) Yes - I'll admit it was very very fast in 16-bit mode, which is what<br>   I wanted to use it for.  Too bad it crashed (in many different ways)<br>   every 20 minutes or so...<br><br>c) Depends on many many things.<br><br><br><br>a) I like it.<br><br>b) Well - PC Magazine seems to think it is.<br><br>c) Yes, this appears to be true :-)<br><br>d) As to greatest thing since sliced bread, I doubt it.  Better cards are<br>   coming out.  Who knows, maybe ATI will come out with something faster yet.<br>   Several reviews I read rated one Pycon Winjet card as a superior performer <br>   at a cheaper price except for availability of drivers, which Pycon was <br>   developing at that time.  (PC Magazine, about two months or so back)<br><br>   Overall, the card has a lot of potential, but you have to be able to use it.<br> <br><br>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>That is the end of the questions. These were the most discussed items in this<br>group so I thought they needed confirmation. For those of you not familiar<br>with the card I have included a summary here (from an ATI ad since I don't have<br>an Graphics Ultra yet.)<br><br>ATI Graphics Ultra Plus:<br>- Accelerated 1024x768 at 65K colours<br>- True colour(16.7M) at 800x600<br>- Multimedia Video Acceleration (for Indeo Video,RLE and Video 1 compressed)<br>  Stretch full motion video windows to full size<br>- Fast VGA<br>- Includes 3 button mouse (ISA versions only)<br>- Anti-aliased fonts (ed. avail in 16 colour mode only,I think)<br>- Real-time pan and zoom across large virtual windows desktop<br>- Around a 1/2 length card size<br>- Priced from $400 U.S.<br><br>ATI Graphics Ultra Pro:<br>- Everything in Graphics Ultra Plus<br>- Faster performance with VRAMS<br>- Accelerated 1280x1024 at 256 colours 74Hz non-interlaced<br>- Available in ISA, EISA and Microchannel<br>- Priced from $600 U.S.<br><br>ATI Technologies<br>(416) 756-0718<br><br>I hope this summary can be of use to you.<br><br>Al<br><br>P.S.

The first attempt failed in the summer<br> of 1992 (the voting deadline was August 31, 1992).  The voting rules<br> state that another attempt for creating newsgroups can be started<br> after a six month waiting period (in this case, it is March 1, 1993).<br> This is the first attempt at creating comp.os.os2.multimedia and<br> comp.os.os2.bugs.<br><br> This document contains:<br> *  the background showing the need for these proposals<br> *  the proposed charters for these proposals<br> *  voting instructions<br> *  a voting ballot<br> *  some example ballots<br> *  the voting rules<br> *  the voting schedule<br> *  the Mass Acknowledgement<br><br><br>Background:<br><br> The creation of two, free, 32-bit compilers for OS/2 2.x (gcc/2<br> and emx/gcc; read comp.os.os2.programmer for details) has spurred<br> a continuing deluge of software ported from UNIX platforms, such<br> as emacs, less, awk, grep, sed, xscheme, ispell, flex, yacc, and<br> much more.  Borland has released its C/C++ compiler for OS/2 2.x,<br> allowing for easier porting of DOS and Windows software.<br><br> Much of the PC hardware and drivers were written for DOS, and<br> later, Windows.  As more people are discovering OS/2 2.x, the<br> number of people asking questions about OS/2's compatibility<br> with their hardware increases, as does the questions on the<br> availability of drivers for their hardware, installation<br> procedures, etc.<br><br> Multimedia is becoming popular.  OS/2 2.0 supports Windows<br> Multimedia Extensions using Win-OS/2 3.0.  Furthermore, IBM is<br> including direct multimedia support in OS/2 starting with version<br> 2.1 (in addition to using Win-OS/2 3.1).<br><br> Any non-trivial software will have bugs -- OS/2 is not exempt,<br> especially since IBM is constantly adding new features to OS/2.<br> So far, IBM has issued system patches and corrective service disks<br> (e.g.  the Service Pak) for free (free from BBSs and ftp sites, or<br> for free plus a small media charge for diskettes -- read<br> comp.os.os2.misc for details).<br><br><br>Proposed Charters:<br><br> (a)  create comp.os.os2.programmer.porting (unmoderated)<br><br>  It will provide a forum for developers of ported software so<br>  as to coordinate efforts, avoid duplication of effort, and<br>  spur additional development.  The group will also cover<br>  topics such as porting from other platforms (such as DOS,<br>  Windows, UNIX, etc), toolkits which aid in program<br>  portability (including porting tools such as Mirrors), and<br>  so forth.<br><br> (b)  rename: comp.os.os2.programmer.misc (unmoderated)<br><br>  To keep the structure of the OS/2 newsgroup heirarchy<br>  orthogonal, comp.os.os2.programmer should be renamed to<br>  comp.os.os2.programmer.misc.<br><br>  comp.os.os2.programmer.misc will still be the newsgroup<br>  for OS/2 programmers to discuss programming issues and<br>  technical aspects of OS/2 in an unmoderated setting.<br><br> (c)  create comp.os.os2.setup (unmoderated)<br><br>  It will be devoted to OS/2 system setup topics, including the<br>  availability of device drivers, compatibility information,<br>  installation procedures, system requirements, and overall<br>  performance optimization.<br><br> (d)  create comp.os.os2.multimedia (unmoderated)<br><br>  It will provide a forum for discussion of multi-media issues.<br><br> (e)  create comp.os.os2.bugs (unmoderated)<br><br>  It will provide a forum for OS/2 system bug reports, bug<br>  diagnosis and work arounds, the availability of system<br>  patches and corrective service disks, and so forth.<br><br>  [Note that discussion of bugs in applications belong in other<br>  newsgroups, and discussion of bugs in OS/2 betas belong in<br>  comp.os.os2.beta]<br><br><br>How to Vote:<br><br> To cast your vote, fill out the ballot below and e-mail it to me.<br> Many newsreaders will allow e-mail to be sent by replying to this<br> post.

The voting rules<br> state that another attempt for creating newsgroups can be started<br> after a six month waiting period (in this case, it is March 1, 1993).<br> This is the first attempt at creating comp.os.os2.multimedia and<br> comp.os.os2.bugs.<br><br> This document contains:<br> *  the background showing the need for these proposals<br> *  the proposed charters for these proposals<br> *  voting instructions<br> *  a voting ballot<br> *  some example ballots<br> *  the voting rules<br> *  the voting schedule<br> *  the Mass Acknowledgement<br><br><br>Background:<br><br> The creation of two, free, 32-bit compilers for OS/2 2.x (gcc/2<br> and emx/gcc; read comp.os.os2.programmer for details) has spurred<br> a continuing deluge of software ported from UNIX platforms, such<br> as emacs, less, awk, grep, sed, xscheme, ispell, flex, yacc, and<br> much more.  Borland has released its C/C++ compiler for OS/2 2.x,<br> allowing for easier porting of DOS and Windows software.<br><br> Much of the PC hardware and drivers were written for DOS, and<br> later, Windows.  As more people are discovering OS/2 2.x, the<br> number of people asking questions about OS/2's compatibility<br> with their hardware increases, as does the questions on the<br> availability of drivers for their hardware, installation<br> procedures, etc.<br><br> Multimedia is becoming popular.  OS/2 2.0 supports Windows<br> Multimedia Extensions using Win-OS/2 3.0.  Furthermore, IBM is<br> including direct multimedia support in OS/2 starting with version<br> 2.1 (in addition to using Win-OS/2 3.1).<br><br> Any non-trivial software will have bugs -- OS/2 is not exempt,<br> especially since IBM is constantly adding new features to OS/2.<br> So far, IBM has issued system patches and corrective service disks<br> (e.g.  the Service Pak) for free (free from BBSs and ftp sites, or<br> for free plus a small media charge for diskettes -- read<br> comp.os.os2.misc for details).<br><br><br>Proposed Charters:<br><br> (a)  create comp.os.os2.programmer.porting (unmoderated)<br><br>  It will provide a forum for developers of ported software so<br>  as to coordinate efforts, avoid duplication of effort, and<br>  spur additional development.  The group will also cover<br>  topics such as porting from other platforms (such as DOS,<br>  Windows, UNIX, etc), toolkits which aid in program<br>  portability (including porting tools such as Mirrors), and<br>  so forth.<br><br> (b)  rename: comp.os.os2.programmer.misc (unmoderated)<br><br>  To keep the structure of the OS/2 newsgroup heirarchy<br>  orthogonal, comp.os.os2.programmer should be renamed to<br>  comp.os.os2.programmer.misc.<br><br>  comp.os.os2.programmer.misc will still be the newsgroup<br>  for OS/2 programmers to discuss programming issues and<br>  technical aspects of OS/2 in an unmoderated setting.<br><br> (c)  create comp.os.os2.setup (unmoderated)<br><br>  It will be devoted to OS/2 system setup topics, including the<br>  availability of device drivers, compatibility information,<br>  installation procedures, system requirements, and overall<br>  performance optimization.<br><br> (d)  create comp.os.os2.multimedia (unmoderated)<br><br>  It will provide a forum for discussion of multi-media issues.<br><br> (e)  create comp.os.os2.bugs (unmoderated)<br><br>  It will provide a forum for OS/2 system bug reports, bug<br>  diagnosis and work arounds, the availability of system<br>  patches and corrective service disks, and so forth.<br><br>  [Note that discussion of bugs in applications belong in other<br>  newsgroups, and discussion of bugs in OS/2 betas belong in<br>  comp.os.os2.beta]<br><br><br>How to Vote:<br><br> To cast your vote, fill out the ballot below and e-mail it to me.<br> Many newsreaders will allow e-mail to be sent by replying to this<br> post.

If you vote more than once, only the most<br>   recent vote will be counted.<br><br> * Votes must be mailed to me by the person voting.  Proxy voting,<br>   forwarding, posting votes to a newsgroup, etc. will not be counted.<br><br> * Do not ask how the votes are going.  The status of the votings<br>   will be revealed only after the poll closes.<br><br> * I will acknowledge votes by Mass Acknowledgement (ACK).  I will<br>   post the ACK twice (see Schedule below).<br><br> * If you need help for using your editor, using e-mail, how<br>   voting works in general, etc. then ask an expert at your site.<br>   Also see the ``How To Create a New Newsgroup'' article which is<br>   posted to news.answers on a regular basis.<br><br> * If you need any clarifications on voting procedures for this<br>   CFV, send me e-mail at mlevis@ringer.cs.utsa.edu.<br><br> * When the voting period is over (see Schedule below), a proposal<br>   passes if both of the following formulas are true:<br>   1)  the number of YES votes exceeds the number of NO votes<br>       by at least 100 (i.e. YES >= NO + 100, or YES - NO >= 100).<br>   2)  the number of YES votes exceeds at least twice the<br>       number of NO votes (i.e. YES >= 2 * NO, or YES - NO >= NO).<br>   In other words, a proposal passes if:<br>       YES - NO >= max (100, NO)<br>   where max() returns the highest number given to it.<br><br><br>Schedule:<br><br> The voting period started on March 29 when the first CFV was posted<br> by David Lawrence (the news.announce.newgroups moderator).<br><br> This third CFV is a repeat of the first CFV, but it also has the<br> Mass Acknowledgement (ACK) of names and e-mail addresses of those who<br> have already voted -- re-send your vote if it is not there.  If you<br> have not voted yet, vote now!<br><br> The voting period will end at 11:59:59 pm (Central Time), on<br> April 24, 1993.  Votes received after that time will not count.<br> The voting results and tally will be posted shortly after that<br> date.<br><br><br>Mass Acknowledgement:<br><br> Here is the list of people who have
