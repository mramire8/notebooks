0	1)BIOS programming on 286 and 386.	      I am interested in the following topics.<br><br>1)BIOS programming on 286 and 386.<br>2)Memory management in 286 and 386.<br>3)Developing Visual Basic Custom Controls.<br><br>     I would like to have your valuable opinion on the books<br>that are best in the above topics.  Please send a mail to<br>rmehta@paul.rutgers.edu . I will post a summary of the <br>suggestions.<br><br>  2**32-1  thanks in advance.
1	I think Washburn has very competitive prices compared to other AMI distributers,plus I liked  the fact he's a EE that knows what he's talking about<br>concerning hardware, and he can be easily reached via CompuServe for non  <br>critcle questions, and is very informative to his customers over the phone.

0	compressed disks are actually "logical" disks.	<br>you might want to look in windows FAQ for this one, but here is my best<br>explanation.  But I can't guarantee that I'm not way off base...<br><br>The permenant swap file is read/written to by windows by talking<br>directly to the hard disk controller card.  The controller card must<br>use the protocal set up by western digital (or something like that).<br>Windows creates a file called spart.par in your windows directory that<br>points to that file.  It then uses the physical information about your<br>disk to index to information in that file.<br><br>compressed disks are actually "logical" disks.  These disks have different<br>characteristics than the actual physical disk.  Furthermore, the information<br>on the compressed disks must be uncompressed before it is used.  (i.e it must<br>go through the decompression program that traps disk reads at the operating<br>system level or the BIOS level).  Because of this "inbetween" program, windows<br>cannot use direct methods to read from the "logical" disk.<br><br>a permenant swap file is only there to "reserve" an area of the disk that<br>windows can use and to block that space from DOS.  Windows would theoretically<br>not even have to access the file from DOS to use that disk space. (I don't<br>know if it does or doesn't...but it checks for it somewhere everytime you<br>boot windows.)<br><br>a temporary swap file is just a normal DOS file that is accessed by windows<br>via DOS and the BIOS.  If a disk compression program or other TSR is loaded<br>the file access must go through DOS...TSR'S (disk compression)...and BIOS in<br>order to be access. (i.e. NEVER USE A TEMPORARY SWAP FILE...NEVER)<br><br>more on permenent swap files...<br><br>i'm sure everyone who has an uncompressed part of their compressed hard disk<br>has seen the message "you have selected a swap file greater than the suggested<br>size...windows will only use the size suggested...do you wan't to create this<br>swap file anyway" or something like that.<br><br>well, a friend of mine (ROBERT) called microsoft and asked them what and why.<br>what they said is that windows checks the amount of free disk space and<br>divides that number by 2.  Then it checks for the largest contiguous block<br>of free disk space.  Windows then suggests the smaller of the two numbers.<br><br>They also said that under absolutely no circumstances...NONE!...will windows<br>uses a swap file larger than the suggested size.  Well...that's what he <br>said!<br><br>I call bull@#$#.  If this is true why does windows report the memory is<br>available to me if it's not going to use it?<br><br>any takers?<br><br>James

0	****************************************************************************<br><br>Borland has a product called Paradox Engine that does just what you want.	On my own I was able to find out about Codebase, Accsys, and Q+E. Codebase<br>and Accsys are C libraries without SQL. Q+E is a Windows application<br>that can be communicated through Windows DDE calls, where you send a SQL<br>string and receive the results.<br><br>Most people wrote to tell me about the Paradox Engine from Borland. Other <br>products mentioned were: Microsoft's ODBC, Accsys, Quadbase, Codebase,<br>RBASE, and Q+E. Only ODBC, Quadbase, RBASE, and Q+E have SQL.<br><br>For myself, I decided on Codebase, mostly because it has an ANSI C<br>portability version that runs under DOS, UNIX, etc, and includes the<br>source code, and portability is important in my application. It works<br>with DBASE, FoxPro, or Clipper files.<br><br>However, I feel that Microsoft's ODBC looks very promising.<br>It's mostly a formalisation of building and submitting SQL queries, and<br>formatting query results. As the responses say, it's available via ftp,<br>except it's effectively unusuable without two manuals:<br>the "ODBC Programmer's Reference" and the "ODBC SDK Guide". Moreover,<br>ODBC doesn't actually interpret SQL and liase with databases, that's <br>up to drivers that should be provided by database manufacturers. Also,<br>it's Windows only (it's actually an extension to the Windows SDK). <br>Nevertheless, it's a start at a SQL interface standard, and should<br>make life interesting in the future.<br><br>Here's my original post, followed by the responses, separated by <br>a line of asterisks (*).<br><br><br>****************************************************************************<br><br>Borland has a product called Paradox Engine that does just what you want. <br>The current version is 3.0, which is fully compatible with (ack) Paradox<br>4.0.

1	I have not found any corresponding reference in the<br>specs for the 8042 PC-KB interface.	  I have heard that somewhere there exist programmable keyboards, eg. one<br>can program displays on the keys to show some specific characters, et.c.<br>  Does it mean that there is some way of transmitting some "non-trivial" data<br>to the KB (as opposed to standard NumLock/... On-Off, typeamatic specs.) from<br>inside the PC software? I have not found any corresponding reference in the<br>specs for the 8042 PC-KB interface. Anyone have any ideas?

1	There are 8 banks of 8 switches, 2 banks of 4 switches, and<br>7 jumpers.	Anyway, here's  description of the card:  It is a 16-bit card, although<br>I noticed that none of the contacts in the 16-bit extension are connected<br>to anything.  It has 4 NS16550AN chips in sockets, and 4 corresponding<br>connecters labeled COM1 - COM4.  There is also an external female connector<br>with 37 pins.  There are 8 banks of 8 switches, 2 banks of 4 switches, and<br>7 jumpers.  I believe that I have determined, by following traces, that<br>SW5 and SW6 (12 switches in all) control the interrupt level for each of<br>the COM ports.  SW5[1-4] are for IRQ3, SW5[5-8] are for IRQ4, and SW6[1-4]<br>are for IRQ5.  The other switches are beyond my meager ability to follow.<br>      <br>The only identification printed on the board is "MULTI SERIAL PORT BOARD"<br>across the bottom.  There is a box for serial number, but it is blank.<br>Immediately below the words "SERIAL NO", but not in the box left for<br>the S/N, are the numbers "1990 2 8".<br><br>Anyone have any clues?  Your help is greatly appreciated.<br>

Ie will changing the stack size on<br>   entry be of use.. Two articles I've read on the subject have given <br>   conflicting views...

Do people forget that the IDE was specifically<br>designed to interface directly with the AT ISA bus? We've seen<br>IDEs come out for EISA, XT ISA, and now even MCA, but at all times<br>it was a 16 bit standard, running at somewhere near 8-10 Mhz. When<br>you run an IDE off of the VLB, there's no way that you're running it<br>at 33 Mhz, it would burn up. Of course same goes for SCSI, ESDI, whatever,<br>none of them run at CPU speed.<br><br>The only way to gain advantage with a VLB IDE is to hook it up to<br>a caching controller. I suspect it would be much, much better to<br>get a software disk cache instead, since you get write-caching as well.<br><br><br>I've seen some Fuji IDE drives going as high as 1G.

Now, here's the key: NEC *knows* that<br>the >=15" monitors' adjustments are very sensitive to shipping over<br>distances (with all the bumps, rough handling, and such) and therefore<br>*expect* and (at least in theory) *require* that the local *distributor*<br>(not dealer) have it adjusted at the *local* service centre (Bull HN<br>Information Systems in Toronto) before sale. This is the correct and<br>probably only way of having any chance of receiving a "perfect" monitor<br>(the definition of "perfect" seems to depend on how picky one is, in my<br>case quite :).<br><br><br>I, for one, was not willing to accept what I considered a substandard<br>monitor and, after two months of wrangling and direct contact with NEC,<br>finally received a satisfactorily adjusted monitor (not perfect, IMHO,<br>but a major improvement over what the dealer and distributor were trying<br>convince me was "normal").

0	The program looks like something that was intended for<br>internal use only.	I wonder whether Microsoft intended for sysedit to be used, or if it was<br>just a holdover from the testing period and they forgot to take it out. The<br>reason I think this is because there is absolutely no mention in the manuals<br>about this program, and there is no online help for it (just an About entry<br>under the File menu). The program looks like something that was intended for<br>internal use only. It's kind of a shame, though. It would have made a nice<br>multi-file replacement for Notepad.

0	It is very easy to use.	1. WORKSPACES 1.10 (wspace.zip)<br>                                This was the smallest and simplest<br>   of the workspace managers that I found.  It is very easy to use.<br>   It displays a small window, containing 6 buttons, plus an extra<br>   button for configuration purposes.  One annoying feature was the<br>   title window that is first presented when it is run - you must press<br>   a key (not a mouse button!) for the thing to go away.  Also, it would<br>   have been nice if there was an "ALWAYS ON TOP" setting for the little<br>   window containing the workspace buttons.  Maybe some user-specified<br>   strings on the buttons instead of the numbers one to six might be<br>   a nice feature.  The simplicity and ease of use of this workspace<br>   manager makes it an attractive package.<br><br>2. WORKSHIFT 1.6 (wrksft16.zip)<br>                               While this workspace manager offered a<br>   few features that WORKSPACES 1.10 lacked, it was quite time consuming<br>   to set things up.  With WORKSPACES 1.10, all but the first workspace<br>   is initially empty.  With WORKSHIFT 1.6, you need to take "snapshots"<br>   of how you want each of your workspaces to look like - i.e. what <br>   applications they contain.  Also, the main window is quite large,<br>   but this does allow you to have a small view of what is in each workspace.<br>   With WORKSPACES 1.10, there was no facility for viewing what was in<br>   a workspace without switching to it.  WORKSHIFT 1.6 provides this<br>   viewing functionality which is quite useful.<br><br>3. BIGDESK 2.30 and BACKMENU (backdesk.zip)<br>                            This is an interesting package, which contains<br>   a few other goodies as well as a workspace manager.  Other goodies<br>   include "Backmenu", which provides a pop-up root menu when you<br>   press a certain mouse button - just like in X-Windows.  The menu<br>   is totally configurable, offering unlimited depth of cascading menus,<br>   which is provides quite handy access to applications.  You could<br>   say it is a menu-based alternative to the program manager.  Also<br>   bundled in "backdesk.zip" is a program called "WRUN", which allows<br>   you to run windows applications from a DOS shell under WINDOWS<br>   instead of using the File Manager to run applications.  <br>   The actual workspace manager is called BIGDESK 2.30.  BIGDESK works quite<br>   differently to the other two workspace managers in that it<br>   doesn't provide a certain number of disjoint and separate workspaces.<br>   In fact, it basically enlarges your desktop by a configurable amount,<br>   and you choose which region of the desktop you want your screen to<br>   focus in on.  This means you can have windows overlapping between different<br>   viewing regions, unlike the first two workspace managers in which<br>   each workspace was isolated from the other one.  The BIGDESK control window<br>   allows to to move windows around your enlarged desktop.  Basically<br>   the control window provides a small scale view of your viewing area<br>   while your actual computer screen provides a large scale or blow-up<br>   of a particular section.

Somebody might be able to correct the details in case I've mis-rememberred<br>them, but I think you have to change the menu program (if you have the sources)<br>or add a TSR or system patch or something.

The first one is labeled as follows:<br>C1<br>C2<br>S2<br>P2<br>P1<br>G<br><br>The second bank is labeled "IRQ" and has the following labels:<br>5C<br>5S<br>4<br>3<br>3S<br>2C<br>2S<br><br>I have determined that the C1 & C2 jumpers tell it to address the first<br>serial port as COM1 or COM2. The P1,P2 jumpers tell it to use the printer<br>port as LPT1 or LPT2. I am guessing that the "G" enables the game port and<br>the "S2" SHOULD enable the second serial port, but I can't get it to work. I<br>have tried numerous setting on the IRQ bank without success. I assume that<br>this bank must tell the card which IRQ's to use for both ports, but I don;t<br>know how.

1	So.. REM out<br>the Adaptec drivers once more.. and reboot.	So you add the BusLogic drivers to the config.sys on the CD-ROM boot disk, and<br>REM out the Adaptec drivers.<br><br>Then you install the whole 1st half of the Beta.. and it won't work! IBM<br>nicely copies in the Adaptec drivers once again. (Thanks IBM!) So.. REM out<br>the Adaptec drivers once more.. and reboot. If you have everything in the<br>right order.. it will work.<br><br>Things are pretty smooth through the rest of the installation.. except OS/2<br>will try to install the Adaptec SCSI drivers once again at the end... so.. you<br>are off to more REM statements and more fun. <br><br>The BT 542Bk comes with drivers and costs the same as the Adaptec cards that<br>do not come with drivers. The DOS drivers work great. This card can easily be<br>configured to work with 8 different sets of I/O ports (and you can use<br>multiple host adapters in one machine) If you get a new card.. it will also be<br>able to support up to 8 GB drives under DOS.<br><br>Hope this helps..<br><br>- Dan<br><br>

0	TT<br>allows for much more flexibility in this area as well.	TrueType is a much richer and more robust hinting language than Type 1 (the hinting<br>of diagonals for instance, which TT does and Type 1 cannot). If you check out the<br>Windows 3.1 core fonts (Times, Arial, Courier, Symbol, Wingdings) you'll see what can<br>be done with TT. There are other fonts out there that have been hand-hinted and not<br>just converted. Some of the Microsoft TT Font Pack 2 fonts are hinted very well.<br><br><br>Again, not true. The characters in a TT or Type 1 font depend on the maker. If someone<br>converts a Type 1 font to TT they'll only get the characters in the font of orgin. TT<br>allows for much more flexibility in this area as well. You can have thousands of glyphs<br>in a TT font file (Mac/PS/Windows/Unicode char set) and use the characters appropriate<br>for the particular platform you are running the font on. For instance, all or our fontpack<br>2 TT fonts have the Mac/Windows char set in them. The metrics of the fonts are such that<br>if the font is brought over to the mac the user will have access to the full mac char set.<br><br><br><br>Hope this clears up some of the confusion. Feel free to contact me if anyone would like<br>more info.<br><br>Regards,

Are SCSI versions of IDE drives able<br>to deliver higher sustained transfer rates to their SCSI interface (because<br>of a higher RPM platter, different arrangement of heads, etc?)?<br><br><br>If data is going from one drive to another, and if SCSI has the ability to<br>perform that transfer without the data having to go through the CPU or main<br>memory, then yes, that is the optimal way to do it.  As far as I know, IDE<br>can't do that.  But when the CPU wants data from both drives (data to be stored<br>in main memory) are you saying that SCSI can grab data from both drives <br>at the same time *and* store/transfer that data to main memory also at the<br>same time?  Working off 1 IRQ and 1 DMA channel on an ISA (or whatever) bus?<br><br><br>A friend of mine just got a Maxtor 245 meg IDE drive for $320.  (that's 245<br>million bytes, or 234 mega-bytes).

Does your figure include a few<br>hundred $$$ for SCSI drivers?<br><br><br>So you're saying that SCSI would have been the default interface type,<br>considering that the vast majority of PC's don't have cd-rom drives or<br>tape backups or etc?  That most PC's only have (or had) 1 hard drive and<br>run DOS?  That SCSI hard drives cost a lot more than MFM or RLL drives<br>at the time?  (and how common were SCSI drives under 80 megs 4 to 10 years<br>ago?)  There's a lot more than the lack of a common interface card that<br>prevented SCSI from becoming the connection medium of choice.<br><br><br>But on that point, is it faster?  This is what all this is about.  Do you<br>get more performance for the money.  For all the people that will only have<br>a single hard drive in their system (regardless of the OS) will the SCSI<br>choice really give them more performance than IDE?<br><br><br>True, but expandibility can also start on the bus, which means the option<br>is there for cd-rom drives or tape backups that run off their own cards.<br><br><br>No argument.

1	This program tests various operations and reports the results<br>in pixels/second.	In going with the modern trend, the Orchid P9000 card only supports 16 colors<br>in 640x480 mode without a driver.  Of course, this breaks any DOS program<br>which uses SVGA modes (like most of my CD-ROMs).  The Compudyne Whiplash VGA,<br>Orchid Fahrenheit 1280, and Orchid F. VLB all share this limitation.  Those<br>are all S3 cards, which means it is an S3 problem for them (the P9000 uses<br>a Weitek VGA chip which also doesn't support them).  The Hercules Graphite<br>card does seem to have these modes, but I didn't run the same test cases as<br>I did on the other boards during the brief time I had it.  It was able to<br>print the splash screen for the Grolier's Encyclopedia, though, which the S3<br>cards just printed as hash, which is why I suspect the SVGA modes are supported.<br><br>The supported resolutions really annoy me.  You can do 1280x1024 at 75Hz if<br>you tell the driver you have an NEC 5FG (they only have about six monitors<br>listed plus 'Generic', and if you choose Generic you can't get any high<br>refreshes at ALL).  But at 1024x768 you are limited to 70Hz.  Seems to me<br>that the hardware should be able to support the bandwidth (if it can do 75Hz<br>at 1280 it sure should be able to do it at 1024!).  Higher vertical resolution<br>was the main reason I bought the card over the Orchid F. VLB I currently have,<br>and it will do 1024x768x70 Hz as well.<br><br>The higher graphics modes all crash HP Dashboard.  I just got off the phone<br>with Orchid, and with the 1.1 drivers (I don't know what I have) he was unable<br>to recreate the problem.  On the plus side, their tech rep was as helpful as<br>he could be and booted up the program on his computer to verify he didn't have<br>the problem.  He didn't know why they limited the refresh to 70 Hz either.<br><br>The board is faster that the OFVLB for most things according to the Hercules<br>Speedy program. This program tests various operations and reports the results<br>in pixels/second.  I don't have the numbers for the Graphite card, but they<br>were close to half of the OFVLB (ie, slower) but that was running in a 20MHz<br>386, ISA, so the numbers aren't really comparable.  The following numbers<br>were all obtained using a 486, 33 MHz, AIR motherboard (UMC chipset), with<br>8 MB memory.  I give ranges because the program reports the numbers as it<br>computes them, and these tend to jump around a bit.<br><br><br>K means thousand (not 1024), M means million, pixels per second<br><br>             Orchid Fahrenheit VLB                  Orchid P9000<br>Chip                 S3 805                          Weitek 9000<br>DIB to Screen        182K - 190K                     228K - 240K<br>Memory to Screen     5.9M - 6.2M                     8.4M - 8.9M<br>Screen to Screen     14M - 14.8M                     29M - 30.8M<br>Vector, solid        2.4M                            2.8M - 2.9M<br>Vector, styled       55K - 58K                       449K - 473K<br>Polygon, shaded      1.8M - 2.1M                     1.6M - 1.9M<br>Polygon, hatched     6.9M - 7.9M                     1.3M - 1.7M<br>Ternary Rops         1.9M - 2.4M                     477K - 520K<br>Font                 130K - 160K                     46K - 55K / 1.2M<br><br>The DIB to Screen test takes a device independent bitmap of a face and transfers<br>it to the screen.

Kinda fun.  8)<br><br>     First problem I can forsee is that the ST-251 will not be<br>compadible with that WD card unless it has the right bios rom.  <br><br>    Check the numbers on it.  It should be the only non-smt chip on<br>the board.  Slightly below center, and left.    The bios should read <br>either :     62-000042-015 or<br>             62-000094-0x2<br><br>     If the last 3 digits are 013, you got problems.<br><br><br>    Looks right.   W5 and W7 are factory jumped (with a trace) between<br>pins 1 and 2 to select the primary controller address.<br><br><br>    Looks right.<br>  <br>[art deleted]<br><br><br>      I notice you left out the S1 jumper table settings.   Those are<br>what control what drive the controller thinks it has.   If you have<br>the 62-000042-015 rom, set it like this:<br><br>              5 + +    open<br>              6 + +    open             <br>              7 + +    open        <br>              8 + +    open<br>              4 + +    closed<br>              3 + +    closed<br>              2 + +    open<br>              1 + +    open<br><br>    Note:   those are how WD runs the numbers on the jumper block.<br>Top to bottom.   +'s represent the jumper pins.    Pins 3,4, and 8<br>select the first drive setting (drive 0) and pins 1,2 and 7 select the<br>second drive (drive 1).   <br><br>      If you have the 62-000094 rom, it's a auto-config, and I'll have<br>to look up how to do it... I don't have the big book right here.<br><br><br>      See above.  You might have problems if the S1 jumpers are not<br>right.   Also,  at the risk of being insulting, make sure the cables<br>are on right and good. 8).    On the jumper on the 251, try moving it<br>to the opposite side of the drive.    It's one or the other.   <br>     The narrow data cable goes to J2.   I've thrown it on J3 a few<br>times and banged my head for a day.....<br><br><br>     Dunno.    IBM roms had to be later than 10/27/82.   A quick way<br>to check is to boot dos and run debug.   Enter:<br>       <br>        -d f000:fff5 fffc    (the - is the debug prompt)<br>   <br>    This will return the rom date, if it's of any use.<br><br><br>      If I oversimplified any of the above, I appologize.     It's<br>just hard to know what caliber of person I'm talking to. 8).<br><br>                     -->   Bob Valentine  <--  <br>                  --> ravalent@mailbox.syr.edu <--  <br><br><br><br>From chpp@unitrix.utr.ac.za Mon Apr  5 06:33:46 1993<br>Received: from unitrix.utr.ac.za by ponder (5.61/1.36)<br> id AA16194; Mon, 5 Apr 93 06:32:59 -0500<br>Received: by unitrix.utr.ac.za (Smail3.1.28.1 #1)<br> id m0nfpMA-0001X7C; Mon, 5 Apr 93 13:28 GMT<br>Message-Id: <m0nfpMA-0001X7C@unitrix.utr.ac.za><br>From: chpp@unitrix.utr.ac.za (Prof P.

To solve this problem, one of the ROM BIOS chips <br>          must be disabled.  To disable the BIOS on your Western Digital  <br>          XT controller card, you must remove the jumper at position W-3 <br>          or add a jumper at position R-23 (depending on which model of XT <br>          controller you are using).<br>          <br>                                       -2-<br><br><br>          <br>          NOTE 2:  TANDY 1000 SYSTEMS - The WD1002A-WX1, WD1004A-WX1, <br>          WDXT-GEN2 and the WD1004-27X can be modified to operate in <br>          Tandy 1000 series computers, models SX, TX and the original or <br>          "A" version.  These computers utilize an interrupt of 2 (IRQ2) <br>          instead of IRQ5, the IBM standard.  To modify the WD1002A-WX1 or <br>          the WD1002-27X to operate in these systems, you must cut the <br>          etch between pin 1 and pin 2 at jumper position W-7.  Then <br>          solder pin 2 and pin 3 at the position (W-7).  To complete the <br>          modification, a jumper must be added to position 7 of switch S-1 <br>          (2 rows of 8 pins).  PLEASE NOTE THAT ANY PHYSICAL MODIFICATION <br>          TO YOUR WESTERN DIGITAL HARD DISK CONTROLLER VOIDS THE WARRANTY <br>          ON YOUR BOARD.  To modify the WD1004A-WX1, WDXT-GEN2 or the <br>          WD1004-27X for your Tandy 1000 system, a zero ohm resister must <br>          be soldered to jumper position W-27.

If you are using a disk compressor, though, be aware<br> that TrueType fonts will compress, whereas Type-1 fonts will not<br> (they are encrypted).<br><br>    2. With a 300 dpi laser printer, the "artificial bold" version of a<br> TrueType font is indistingishable from the original, forcing me to<br> install the actual bold (and bold-italic, etc.) variants if I want<br> to use them.  Type-1 PostScript fonts under ATM generate a visually<br> distinct bold variant from the base font.  I realize that the<br> artificial bold font that ATM generates is aesthetically inferior<br> to the hand-generated bold TrueType variant, but it is sufficient<br> for my needs, and not having to install bold variants saves me 50%<br> on disk space (uncompressed).<br>

1	Fact: retail stores never provide a better value in terms of price per product.	Phone support is quick and competent from many mail order firms, but not so<br>quick and not so competent from others (Gateway included).  But my experience<br>with computer retailers (which is significant) has lead to the conclusion that<br>sales personnel and retail-technical personnel are forbidden to actually learn<br>about the products they sell.  Talk about incompetent!  O.K., so a few percent<br>of their answers are correct, but those salesmen don't even realize how stupid<br>they are.   ...  .......  O.K.  ...I'll settle down now....  .... let me<br>catch my breath.....  ..<br><br>Fact: retail stores never provide a better value in terms of price per product.<br><br>Retail outlets are desirable, however, to those people who aren't interested<br>in learning about computers enough to make their own decisions.  This is fine;<br>for example most of my education about carpeting, wall paper, lawn mowers,<br>microwave ovens, etc. has come from sales personnel.  I assume I must be an<br>idiot.  But I don't care about those things.  I do, however, care about my<br>computer - i.e. I demand features and performance, and I'll be damned if I'll<br>pay some high-school drop out commission on an over-rated, over-priced system<br>and in the process be subjected to his distorted B.S.<br><br>G.L.

Fixed by removing<br>  the line STACKS=0,0 from config.sys. The default value STACKS=9,256<br>  does just fine.<br>- Random white pixels all over the screen when moving the mouse, in a<br>  256 color graphical mode (the hardware cursor modes). Fixed by turning<br>  off the hardware scroll ("24xmode scrolloff") before entering the graphics<br>  mode. This also fixed the problem of the windowed DOS boxes under windows.<br>  With the hardware scroll enabled, applications write garbage outside the<br>  window.<br>- The screensavers do not remove the cursor in 256 color modes (hardware<br>  cursor). I don't know if this is a windows problem or a driver problem.<br>  Clearly there should be two types of cursor removing functions: a remove-<br>  for-draw, which can be ignored for hardware cursors and a remove-<br>  unconditionally. Do other cards with hardware cursors have the same problem?<br>- The VESA driver does not support the 640x480x16M TrueColor mode. (Universal<br>  VESA drivers do not run at all).<br>

The alternative approach (to CISC),<br> which has been adopted by many in<br> recent years, has come to be known as "RISC": the Reduced<br> Instruction Set Computer.  This can be characterised simply as<br> "Simpler is Faster"; by simplifying the design (e.g.  by reducing<br> the variety of instructions & addressing modes), the hardware can be<br> designed to run faster.  Even at the cost of needing more<br> instructions, the same task can be done more quickly by the simpler,<br> faster design.<br><br> A typical RISC processor will:<br><br>    o provide a large number of registers (e.g.  32);<br><br>    o perform all data operations on registers;<br><br>    o provide few addressing modes (e.g. immediate or 'register + offset');<br><br>    o only allow load & store operations to access memory;<br><br>    o only use a few instruction formats;<br><br>    o only support a few data types (e.g. integer, unsigned, floating).

1	I don't see any shorter lifespan than the ones we have in the<br>offices which does get turned off at the end of the day.	We have plenty of computer labs where the computers are left on all the<br>time. I don't see any shorter lifespan than the ones we have in the<br>offices which does get turned off at the end of the day. In fact, some<br>of the computers in the labs have outlived some of the same ones in the<br>offices. But it goes both ways so can't conclude anything.
0	Also, a few other questions.	At the end of the summer I'm planning on getting a new computer (486DX50 or<br>486DX2/66) and have been poking around in Computer Shopper.  Anyway I saw<br>the ads for the Diamond Viper (Local Bus, 2MB memory, 50 million+ WinMarks)<br>and was wondering if anyone has had any experience with it (good/bad/not worth<br>the money/etc.)  Any information at all would be nice.<br><br>Also, a few other questions.  Anyone know of a good cheap 15"+ 1024x768 NI<br>monitor?  And what is a good CD-ROM drive that meets MPC standards and is<br>controlled via SCSI?  How about a 250MB tape drive on SCSI?

1	Can I use them to control these devices under 486?	        Please forgive me if this is FAQ. If there is source on this kind of info, <br>please let me know. I just got a 286 station (around 21*16.5*7 in dimension),<br>and I am thinking about upgrade it to a 486 or 386.<br><br>        The station has a power supply, two floppy disk drives, and the big<br>case. I have SONY 1304 monitor, SyQuest drive (Mac), and maybe a cd-rom<br>reader (Mac) for it. Here are the questions I have so far:<br>1) Is there a 486 motherboard at this dimension that I could use the case?<br>2) The original owener has the controller for floppy drive and hard disk<br>removed. Can I use them to control these devices under 486? How much do I<br>have to pay for a new controllers if the old ones won't work?<br>3) How can I make SyQuest (SCSI) and cd-rom (SCSI) work on this station? <br>I heard that there is a cheap sound board that has SCSI controller built-in?<br>What's quality of this board? How much usually does a SCSI control cost?<br>Is there any ftp sites that has SyQuest driver or cd-rom driver for the PC if<br>I can have everything hooked up OK?4) What I want is a 486 motherboard, a sound board to make it a MPC- <br>quality station. How much would it cost to do that? Is it worth the hussle<br>than just buy a new 486 station? BTW, I need to buy a keyboard for it too.<br><br>Any input is welcome.<br><br>Thank you.

I've managed to get<br>one or the other drive up (with the other disconnected), but not both<br>at the same time; whenever I try, the thing hangs during bootup -<br>never gets past the system test.  The IDE controller's instruction<br>sheet says it supports two drives; I think I've configured the CMOS<br>correctly; the power's plugged in properly; I even learned about the<br>master/slave relationship that two HDs are supposed to have (didn't<br>know PCs were into S&M! 8^) and I think I configured the jumpers<br>properly (the 85MB one is the master, the new 210MB one is the slave).<br><br>The only thing I can think of is maybe I'm doing the cabling wrong.  I've<br>tried several combinations:<br><br>controller - master - slave<br>controller - slave - master<br>master - controller - slave<br><br>None of them worked.  Unfortunately, I can't think of any others.<br><br>Another possibility is that the 85MB one is already partitioned into<br>two seperate drives, C and D, and the CMOS asks for "C: drive" and "D:<br>drive" setup info rather than "drive 1" and "drive 2" like most others<br>I've seen.  Could this be confusing things?<br><br>So, I need HELP!  The drive came bereft of any docs, except for some<br>info for the CMOS setup; the controller has a little piece of paper<br>about the size of an index card; I cannibalized the cable (it's one<br>of those with a connector at each end and the one in the middle, so<br>it looks like a serial connection); now I be lost!<br><br>Many, many thanks in advance!  This is practically an emergency (I have<br>two papers to do on this thing for Monday!)!  Help!<br>-- 
1	For this reason, I use the<br>"factory defaults" for position/size on the ATI card<br>and adjust each mode individually (only the first time)<br>at the monitor.	I thought this was a neat feature until I noticed that<br>when an image is re-sized, the scanning frequency is<br>necessarily changed.  This causes digital multiscan<br>monitors like my MAG MX17F to get confused as to which<br>mode to use if the frequency gets too far from the<br>standard selections.  For this reason, I use the<br>"factory defaults" for position/size on the ATI card<br>and adjust each mode individually (only the first time)<br>at the monitor.  The MAG (and many other multiscan<br>monitors) has (have) the ability to recall these settings<br>the next time each mode is "detected".<br>-- <br><br>=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

0	And there is also a free 386BSD I believe.	<br>This list appears to imply, that MS-windows that has a cost listed<br>above at $70, comes with a C compiler, C++ and Fortran.

1	Now I have quite a different<br>problem that has me perplexed like you wouldn't know.	Well, I figured out how the jumpers go.

All the drive tests work, but when the thing comes<br>back around to the a: drive and there is no disk present, it just spins.<br>If you insert a disk into drive a with a system however, it works fine<br>and boots up (ie how installed all my software)<br><br>Any additional help on this will be most welcome....<br><br>swood<br>

0	-- <br>signoff	<br>  I had the same problem.  At first, I thought it was the video driver and <br>  made sure I had the most current drivers, because the problem was most<br>  evident at SVGA resolution modes.  It didn't help and after a bit of<br>  experimentation, determined that the problem existed in standard VGA<br>  resolution mode. It was just much less noticeable.<br>  <br>  My mouse was an older MS serial version I bought second hand in 1990. It<br>  worked just fine in DOS and DOS based graphic applications.  On the <br>  guess that the problem was with the resolution of the mouse, I borrowed<br>  a new mouse (a MS bus model) and tried it.  That solved the problem.<br>  So, if your mouse is old, you may want to try replacing it for a newer<br>  one.<br>  <br><br><br>-- <br>signoff
1	Regards,	One of the ASPI-drivers (I think it's the ASPICD) supports a /NORST<br>paramter, which means to not reset the SCSI bus when it loads. This<br>fixed the problem a friend of mine was having with his adaptec+tosh <br>3401.<br><br>Regards,

1	only up,<br>down, left, etc.	I recently purchased a CH Flightstick.  There aren't any suction cups and<br>no tension adjusters but otherwise it seems to be an excellent joystick. <br>I'm currently using it for the Wing Commander series and Red Baron.  Works<br>quite well.  The large base does not require a steadying hand and so<br>leaves it free.  The buttons provide good tactile response (you can hear<br>and feel them well).  There are other models made by CH that can go up or<br>down in features.<br><br>For price comparison Gravis analogue joysticks sell for ~$35.00 here<br>compared to the $45.00 I paid for a CH Flightstick.  I think the extra<br>$10.00 is worth it just in feel.  Best thing to do is to ask a salesperson<br>to let you try them out or at least feel it before you buy.<br><br>Just another note, analogue joysticks are best for flightsims or something<br>that needs sensitive touch.  If you're only playing games such as Castle<br>Wolfenstein or some other game that only uses digital input (ie. only up,<br>down, left, etc. instead of 'how much right') you might want to look into<br>a Gravis gamepad.  They look like a Nintendo control pad but I don't know<br>much beyond that.

1	Hope that this message is not over your head, but the answer to your <br>question was not simple.	don't believe everything you are told.  I can tell you that mixing them <br>between 'banks' ok, and I can't see why mixing in one bank is not unless <br>they are of different speeds ( e.g. mixing of 60ns and 100ns SIMMs in one <br>bank ).  The two only differ in the type of chips it uses.  Assuming that <br>the SIMMS are 1Mx9 ( 9 bit wide ), here is the two equivalent <br>configuration.  The 3-chip SIMM uses two 4-bit wide 4Mbit (1M of 4-bit <br>nibbles ) and one 1-bit wide 1Mbit chip ( for a total of 9-bit wide 1Mbyte <br>).  The 9-bit SIMM uses nine 1-bit wide 1Mbit chips.  These are equivalent <br>because of the way that it is 'pinned' on the SIMM board.  At the SIMM <br>interface, they both act as 9-bit wide 1MByte SIMMS ( 2*4+1=9*1 ).  [sorry <br>if too techie for ya].<br><br><br>MG>>  Similarly, one cannot plug in two 1MB SIMMs and one 4MB SIMMs to <br>gi<br>MG>> the system a total of 6 MEG. Why is that so ?? If my system supports<br>MG>> of 8 MEG (it has 8 SIMM slots), can I plug in 4 4MB SIMMs to give my<br>MG>> 16MB ??<br><br>That sounds correct.  the problem is that if your computer takes 9-bit <br>wide SIMMs, you can not mix different sizes in one bank.  Why you ask?  <br>Simple,  if you understand why there is banks.  Assuming you have a 32-bit <br>CPU ( 386DX or 486 ), the data bus (e.g. the mechanism to retrieve data <br>from memory ) is 32-bits wide, so the computer expects to see 32 bits when <br>it asks for data.  To get that bandwidth ( 32-bit wide ), the motherboard <br>links 4 1Mx9 ( one bit is not data, but parity, so I will ignore that in <br>this simple explaination ) to get 32bits [ (9-1)*4=32 bits ].  That means <br>that a SIMM in a bank stores only 1/4 of the 32 bit wide data.  If you <br>have a 16-bit bus, two 1Mx9 SIMMs are linked together to get 16-bit wide <br>data, which is the reason why 286 banks are 2 SIMMs wide, and 32-bit banks <br>are 4 SIMMs wide.  If your computer required 1Mx36 ( e.g. 32-bit wide data <br>with 4 parity bits, used in some PS/2s and ASTs ), you could upgrade by <br>one SIMM at a time.<br><br>Hope that this message is not over your head, but the answer to your <br>question was not simple.

1	The menu system 'should' use<br>DOS calls to get the time, which would cause the DOS 'kernel' to do<br>the BIOS call, and the wrap indicator would hence be processed<br>properly.	There are two 'problems':<br>(1) the BIOS TOD routine which updates the BIOS clock uses only 1 bit<br>    for day increment, so a second wrapping of the clock past midnight<br>    will get lost if no one calls the BIOS to read the clock in the<br>    meantime, and<br>(2) the BIOS resets the day wrap indicator on the first 'get date'<br>    call from ANYBODY (after the wrap indicator has been set). So<br>    unless the first BIOS 'get date' call after midnight is done by<br>    the DOS 'kernel' (which is the only part of DOS which knows how to<br>    increment the date, the day wrap indication is normally lost.<br>My guess is that Kevin's 'menu' system uses BIOS calls to read the<br>clock (in order to display the time), and is hence the entity which<br>causes the day wrap indication to get lost. Even if the 'menu' system<br>'notices' the day 'wrap' (which I think is indicated by a non-zero<br>value in AL), there really isn't any particularly good way to tell DOS<br>about it, so that DOS can update the day. The menu system 'should' use<br>DOS calls to get the time, which would cause the DOS 'kernel' to do<br>the BIOS call, and the wrap indicator would hence be processed<br>properly.  Possibly, though, the 'menu' system can't easily use DOS<br>calls for time, because DOS is not reentrant, and perhaps time<br>incrementing ofters occur while the 'menu' system is 'inside' some<br>other DOS call.

0	The game card is a generic $20 gamecard.	Some background:  I have a Leading Edge 486sx25 with Phoenix BIOS.  When I  <br>first got it it had 4Mg of memory.  It ran windows fine (not too many  <br>GPF's).  Then, a couple of weekends ago, I installed Lotus 123 for windows  <br>(with ATM), a game card and an additional 4  1Mg SIMMS.  The Leading edge  <br>machine is kind of strange, in that it has the IDE controler built into  <br>the motherboard, the CPU is actually on a sparate board that plugs into  <br>the motherboard and the SIMMS it uses are Macintosh SIMMS! Apparently I  <br>was told that the Leading Edge had the parity bit built into the mother  <br>board.  The original 4Mg 80ns SIMMS where of the 2 chip variety from  <br>SAMSUNG, and the ones I installed are 8 chip SIMMS. They are recognized  <br>fine by the BIOS RAM check. The game card is a generic $20 gamecard.<br><br>The reason why I mention the hardware like this is that sometimes  <br>rebooting the machine using the reset button or ctl-alt-del still leaves  <br>the machine kind of flaky, but turning it on and off doesn't. <br><br>I haven't tried taking out the RAM or the game card, because as I said  <br>these GPF are not reproducible at will.  I have gone through and entire  <br>day using the computer with no problems and then I might get 5 or so GPF's  <br>in the sppace of 20 minutes?<br><br>What can I do.

I've got unix loaded on one of my pcs (along with windogs) and the OS can only use one of the two IDE drives at one time.  It's pretty ugly.<br><br>I just bought at Quantum 240 for my mac at home.  I paid $369 for it.  I<br>haven't seen IDE drives cheaper.<br><br>: The original CGA cart back in '84 was $300.  I think the original EGA card<br>: (or PGA?) was $800.  SCSI has stood relatively alone in not coming down<br>: in price, mainly because we're talking about PC's and not Sun's or Sparc<br>: or SGI or (name your favorite unix workstation).  That is, after millions<br>: of PC buying decisions over the years, SCSI has had plenty of time to<br>: come down in price.<br><br>No, actually, we're talking about SCSI being expensive simply because<br>nobody did a common interface for the PC.  If they had a common (read:<br>easily implemented) method of adding scsi to a PC (like as in a Sun or<br>Mac), then you'd find SCSI the connection medium of choice.<br><br>: I won't argue that the SCSI standard makes for a good, well implimented<br>: data highway, but I still want to know why it intrinsically better<br>: (than IDE, on an ISA bus) when it comes to multi-tasking OS's when<br>: managing data from a single SCSI hard drive.<br><br>On a single drive, SCSI is more expensive.  But, you bought your PC for<br>expandibility, so, you'd want to add more drives or whatever.  The<br>following are why I find SCSI intrinsically better than IDE:<br><br>A (partial?) list:<br> 1.  You can add many different types of devices and access them <br> concurrently.<br> 2.  A SCSI device works on many different machines (I have a mac<br> and a PC at home and moving hard drives between them is VERY nice<br> with SCSI -- hook them up and away they go)<br> 3.  SCSI devices work together better than IDE devices.  For<br> instance, recently, I added an older connor 100 meg IDE to a maxtor<br> 212 meg IDE.  The connor *MUST* be setup as the slave.  It will<br> work no other way.  On SCSI, you set the address, check the<br> termination, plug it in, and away it goes.<br> 4.  I have a problem with IDE's mutual exclusion - I notice that<br> the time it takes to switch from accessing drive c: to drive d: is<br> quite long as compared to the time it takes to switch from drive c:<br> to d: on a SCSI system.  Under a multitasking OS, this is very<br> noticable, as many things can be going on at once.<br><br>One neat thing that I've noticed lately (a fringe benefit) has been the<br>ability to add older (almost dead) drives as storage on a SCSI system with<br>little problem -- we've got a bunch of almost dead 20 meg drives that I've<br>added to my PC.  I've now got the interface full, but, it does allow me to<br>have 4 20 meg drives, 1 240 meg drive, 1 tape drive, and 1 105 meg drive<br>all on the same card.  <br><br>Simply put, SCSI is handier than IDE.

1	Or do you think NEC is the better drive?	I'm seriously considering buying the Insight Talon TA-2000 MM Kit, which<br>is bundled with the CD-ROM drive with 265-280ms access time, 300Kb dtr,<br>multispin, multi-session Photo CD capability, etc., and with the PAS-16<br>sound card, etc.... (if you are familiar with Insight, you know the kit<br>I mean).  I believe the drive is either a Texel (265ms) or an NEC<br>(280ms), but it is not clear to me which one is actually a part of the<br>bundle (at least two of their sales people couldn't give me a straight<br>answer as to which one; ah, yes, one of the drawbacks of OEM!).<br><br>Other questions:<br><br>- Excuse my ignorance, but is "Texel" a reputable maker in the CD-ROM<br>  market?  Or do you think NEC is the better drive?<br><br>- Bottom line:  Is this kit worth the money?  (Currently, $449 for the<br>  TA-1000, and $699 for the TA-2000)<br><br>Alternatively, I was thinking that the TA-2000 might be overkill for my<br>uses (however, I *do* want full multimedia capabilities, Photo CD stuff,<br>educational programs for my kids, etc.), and considered the lower-end<br>TA-1000 kit and using the difference (around $250.00) to get something<br>else useful, like a tape back-up drive unit.<br><br>Basically, I would just like to hear from those who have actually USED<br>these kits, and whatever pros/cons you might advise, preferably<br>directly to the email address below.<br><br>Thanks,<br><br>Koji

The above conditions<br>  are sorted by my priority.<br>  I think NEC CDR74-1/84-1 is a little bit expensive, but it DOES satisfy<br>  almost all of the above conditions.

0	P.S.	AT any rate, the Actix graphics engine ultra outperforms all the other cards<br>in the 928 class (based on the winmark results).<br><br>If you are looking for the all around best dos/windows performance  check out<br>the actix card. Their 1-800 number is 927-5557.<br><br>P.S. The article in pc magazine noted that if you are a regular dos user (ie:<br>games) then you should also check out the 801 chip from s3. It apparently<br>scores just as well and in many cases slightly better in dos than the 928 chip<br>(ie: stealth and actix cards.) They have "comparable" windows performance and<br>are cheaper to buy.

I found a copy somewhere in wuarchive.wustl.edu<br>a long time ago, but I don't know offhand what directory it was under.  It's<br>GREAT at converting files of all types, including Mac, NExT, Sun, and<br>various PC formats... It's also a great player and editor, with various<br>special effects that put Windows' Sound Recorder to shame.  It requires a<br>driver for various sound cards...

0	The data area is organized as clusters of a fixed size; storage is<br>doled out in "chunks" of one cluster each.	<br>You'll probably want to delete any damaged executables and reload them<br>fresh.  Data files should be examined and repaired.<br><br><br>You're not stupid.  Smartdrive caches things, and Windows also runs a<br>swap file which may contain data also.  All of this is pretty risky<br>stuff in a PC environment.<br><br><br>A reasonably accurate prediction...<br><br><br>Here's a brief description of how DOS stores files:<br><br>There are three pieces to a file.  The directory entry, the FAT chain,<br>and the data area.  You can think of these as a sheet of lined<br>notebook paper, a sheet of graph paper, and a stack of 3X5 cards.<br><br>The directory entry (notebook paper) holds the file name, actual size,<br>and first cluster number.  It also holds some other information that's not<br>important right now.<br><br>The File Allocation Table (FAT) chain (graph paper) tells where to find<br>the actual data.  Each square of graph paper holds a number.  If the<br>number is zero, the cluster associated with this box is available.  If it<br>holds a "magic" number, it is either the last piece of a file or a bad<br>(unuseable) spot on the disk.  Any other number tells which cluster<br>contains the next section of the file.<br><br>The data area (3X5 cards) is where the actual information is stored.<br>The data area is organized as clusters of a fixed size; storage is<br>doled out in "chunks" of one cluster each.  (In your case, one cluster<br>is 2048 bytes.)  As a cluster is filled, another is allocated.<br><br>To read a file, you first look at the directory entry to get the<br>starting cluster number.  Now you read the data from that cluster.<br>Next, look at the FAT entry for the cluster you just read.  This will<br>tell you the cluster number for the next chunk of the file.<br>Naturally, these numbers are usually sequential, but they can jump<br>around and even go backwards.  Continue reading, one cluster at a<br>time, as you walk this chain through the FAT, until you hit the marker<br>which says it's the last cluster in the file.<br><br>CHKDSK is the DOS utility that checks the sanity and coherence of<br>the directories and the FAT and can bludgeon most flaws into<br>submission.  It doesn't have any intelligence, so you have to<br>double-check anything it "fixes".<br><br>Now let's do a bit of a post-mortem:<br><br><br>All of these files have sizes (according to the FAT) which don't match<br>the size reported in their directory entries.  CHKDSK /F will alter<br>the directory entries to match the FAT size.  (In other words,   the<br>directory entry for CVPIC.EXE may say the file is 64,877 bytes long.<br>But CHKDSK found a FAT chain of 43 clusters attached to it.  (My numbers,<br>obviously, are made up.))<br><br><br>Disk space was found which is allocated in the FAT, but is not attached<br>to any directory entry.  CHKDSK /F gives you the option of converting these<br>"lost chains" to files.  You can then examine the files (FILE0000.CHK<br>through FILE0223.CHK) and rename or discard them.  Or, if you tell<br>CHKDSK _not_ to convert them to files, then those clusters will simply<br>be marked "available" in the FAT.<br><br><br><br>...<br><br><br>These files are both referencing the _same_ data cluster.  Obviously,<br>one of them (at least) must be wrong.  It's interesting to note that<br>C:\386SPART.PAR is your Windows swap file...<br><br>To fix this, you should copy each cross-linked file to a new name.<br>This will "fix" the cross-link by giving the files unique data spaces.<br>Now delete the cross-linked files.  Examine the copies and try to<br>assemble them properly.  Good luck.  (Hint:  "Missing pieces" are<br>likely to be found in those "lost chains" at the top...)<br><br><br>Your disk is pretty close to full.  This may be the actual cause of<br>the problem; perhaps Windows needed to expand its swapfile by an<br>amount which exceeded available disk space...<br><br>In any case, the short summary is that something trashed your FAT.<br>There are utilities that can mirror your FAT and help repair damage<br>after something like this, but you have to run them _before_ the<br>problem occurs.

I don't want<br>to send it back and get one with the same or an even worse<br>problem. Does the factory consider this kind of thing normal<br>and ship their monitors with less than perfect alignment? <br>Are other netters just living with these kind of imperfections?<br><br>--

It is just the way the industry uses and talks about it.<br>There are THREE key differences in SCSI; the controller chip, the port, and<br>the software.  THAT IS IT.<br>Let us look as SCSi in from THIS stand point.<br><br>SCSI-1: asynchronous and synchronous modes {SOFTWARE SCSI DRIVER ONLY}<br> asynchronous is slower then synchronous mode {only 0-3MB/s vs. 0-5MB/s}<br> synchronous speeds can be reached by most SCSi-1 divices with a<br> rewrite of the software driver {As is the case for the Mac Quadra.}<br><br>SCSI-2 {8-bit}: THIS is the main source for the confusion. This differs from<br> SCSI-1 ONLY in the controler chip in most machines.  In the Mac and some PCs<br> this is called 'fast SCSI-1' because it uses SCSI-1 ports and software drivers<br> AND can produce SCSI-2 SPEEDS through SCSI-1 INSPITE of this even in the <br> slower asynchronous mode.  Average speed in asynchronous SCSi-1 mode <br> 4-6MB/s with 8MB/s{See in both Quadras and higher end PCs} Synchronous<br> mode just allows a higher burst rate {10/MB/s}<br><br>SCSI-2 {16-bit}: TWO versions-Wide/Fast.  Wide SCSI-2 requires TWO things<br> over 8-bit SCSI-2:  a SCSI-2 software driver and a wide SCSI port on the<br> machine and the external device.<br> Fast SCSI-2 also requires TWO things over 8-bit SCSI-2: SCSI-2 driver<br> software and that the RECIEVING devise support 16-bit fast SCSI-2.<br> Speed of both is the same: 8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst.<br><br>SCSI-2 {32-bit}:  Also know as Wide AND Fast SCSI.  Over 8-bit SCSI-2 this<br> requires: SCSI-2 driver software, wide SCSI-2 port, and that the RECIEVING<br> devices ALSO have a 32-bit mode SCSI-2 chip.  As expected this is VERY<br> expencive.

0	VOTING:<br> The CFV (Call for Votes) will be issued around 19 May, 1993, based on<br> the feedback received during the discussion period.	NAME:   comp.os.ms-windows.nt.setup<br>STATUS:  Unmoderated.<br>PURPOSE: Discussions about setting up and installing Windows NT, and about<br>  system and peripheral compatability issues for Windows NT.<br><br>NAME:  comp.os.ms-windows.nt.misc<br>STATUS:  Unmoderated.<br>PURPOSE: Miscellaneous non-programming discussions about using Windows NT,<br>  including issues such as security, networking features, console<br>  mode and Windows 3.1 (Win16) compatability.<br><br>RATIONALE:<br> Microsoft NT is the newest member of the Microsoft Windows family<br> of operating systems (or operating environments for those who wish<br> to argue about the meaning of an "OS").  The family ranges from<br> Modular Windows through Windows 3.1 and Windows for Workgroups to<br> Windows NT at the high end.  To date, Microsoft has shipped over<br> 50,000 beta copies and pre-release SDKs of Windows NT -- the<br> actual release is slated for May/June '93.<br><br> While Windows NT has an entirely new design internally, it shares<br> an application programming interface with the other members of the<br> Windows family; its Win32 API includes the Win16 API used in Win-<br> dows 3.1, and the Win32s API subset (Win32 less threads, networking<br> and security) can be used to create 32-bit applications for<br> Windows 3.1.<br><br> The user interface is also practically identical to that of Windows<br> 3.1, with the addition of logins and a few other features.  It uses<br> Program Manager, File Manager and other applets, and generally pre-<br> sents an identical appearance to the user.  Many of the announced<br> Windows NT applications are ports of existing Windows 3.1 apps, and<br> NT also runs existing 3.1 applications.<br><br> Thus, it appears logical that Windows NT should share the following<br> groups with the other members of the Windows family:<br>  comp.os.ms-windows.apps<br>  comp.os.ms-windows.programmer.tools<br>  comp.os.ms-windows.programmer.misc<br>  comp.os.ms-windows.programmer.win32<br> <br> The following groups are also clearly applicable to Windows NT as<br> well as Windows 3.1:<br>  comp.os.ms-windows.announce<br>  comp.os.ms-windows.advocacy<br> <br> In conclusion, the only clear argument for the separation of the<br> Windows 3.1 and Windows NT hierarchies is different internal<br> structures of Windows 3.1 and Windows NT.  And yet operating<br> systems such as OS/2, Macintosh OS, Xenix and Coherent all have<br> undergone major rewrites without having been split into separate<br> newsgroup hierarchies.<br><br> Further, Windows 3.1 is due for a major rewrite itself in 1994 --<br> when the fully 32-bit, protected-mode and with-DOS-built-in next-<br> generation Windows, "Chicago", debuts next year, surely it should<br> remain in the same hierarchy.  And what, then, would be the jus-<br> tification for separating Windows NT from other Windows versions?<br><br><br>DISCUSSION PERIOD:<br> The discussion period will run from 27 April, 1992 to 18 May, 1993.  <br><br>VOTING:<br> The CFV (Call for Votes) will be issued around 19 May, 1993, based on<br> the feedback received during the discussion period.  No votes will<br> be accepted prior to the CFV.

0	The<br>       cache will save up so much that when it grabs control of the machine<br>       it takes too long to write to disk and you loose characters.	Try the following:<br>   1) Turn off disk write cache for the disk you are downloading to.  The<br>       cache will save up so much that when it grabs control of the machine<br>       it takes too long to write to disk and you loose characters.<br><br>   2) Use a different UART for your serial line.  The old UART's (8250 or 16450)<br>       can only buffer one character internally.  The new UART's (16550) can<br>       buffer 16, which should be plenty for most situations.  You can run<br>       \windows\msd.exe to find out what UART is on the machine.
0	The 17 had some uncorrectable <br>pincusion and edge distortion problems.	There was nothing really broken with the Viewsonic but overall it did not <br>match up.  I used my ATI Graphics Ultra in setup mode to push the <br>frequencies to their limits and the Viewsonic exhibited some problems that <br>the NEC did not.  I personally like the non-etched NEC with the OCLI filter <br>and the tube on the 17 was not as nice.  The 17 had some uncorrectable <br>pincusion and edge distortion problems.  Also, it would change brightness <br>when I switched modes and I was constantly having to fiddle with the <br>controls.  And the yoke was crooked and I had no way to compensate for the <br>raster that tilted downhill.  On the postive side, although not as handsome <br>as the NEC, the 17 had a smaller footprint and was not as heavy.<br><br>I have heard that Panasonic owns Viewsonic and the model 17 is being sold <br>through OEM channels with a Panasonic label on it.  If it's available that <br>way at a lower cost I could get more serious about it.  For now the NEC has <br>my vote but I'm searching for one of the new, cheaper, NEC 5FGe's to see if <br>it's just as good as its older brother the 5FG before I decide which one to <br>buy.<br><br>I have no experience with the Nanao.

0	(If I had<br> a number to call at HP or Adobe, they'ld have heard from me.)	Q: Which version of Adobe PS will we clone?<br> Aside from the level 1 and level 2 issues, Adobe has in the past released<br> new code that incorporates modifications/upgrades/fixes just as all other<br> software vendors do. The level 2 stuff may seem sound now, but I assure<br> you,changes will become more frequent as their customer list begins to<br> dwindle in the face of competition. This allows them to shift people to<br> maintenance, as well as design efforts for level 3.<br><br>Q: Do we duplicate the bugs, or do we make it work correctly?<br> From the LaserWriter to the LaserJet 4 there have been bugs. (If I had<br> a number to call at HP or Adobe, they'ld have heard from me.) Deciding<br> which approach to take depends on which printer you want to emulate.<br><br>Q: Do we follow the Red Book, or do we follow someone's implementation?<br> Without a doubt, there are differences between the Red Book and Adobe's<br> PS. With level 2 many issues have been refined but the Red Book does<br> leave big, big holes in the implementation specific stuff. It would be<br> nice it the Red Bood at least pined things down enough so that two<br> different implementations of Adobe's PS don't do the exact opposite given<br> an identical set of conditions.<br><br>Q: PSCRIPT.DRV?<br> Having done a lot of PS clone testing myself, the unfortunate side of<br> testing is the limited number of sources for test files. The primary<br> source we use is Genoa. And having characterizes their 1992 PS ATS files,<br> (1300+ of them) over half are taken from PSCRIPT.DRV. It may not ideal,<br> but the ATS files are what the printer vendors use. I'm sure that Adobe<br> uses them too, but Adobe's output is by definition correct, even if its<br> wrong.<br><br>Yes, there are some very poor clones. We've seen them here at Rastek (a sub<br>of Genicom which has its own clone called GeniScript). Some are poor for lack<br>of design, some are poor because they followed the Red Book, and some are poor<br>because the vendors don't know what PS is.

My<br>overall impression is that Quicken is a financial accounts manager<br>while Managing Your Money will help you more completely manage your<br>finances.<br><br>Here are some features that I believe Managing Your Money and Quicken share:<br><br> The ability to keep records for each of your financial accounts:<br> checking, savings, charge, cash, or brokerage.  You can reconcile<br> your account statements with the records the program keeps.<br><br> The ability to make a budget and track your spending against that<br> budget.<br><br> A Checkfree module which will allow you to use the Checkfree bill<br> paying service to pay your bills via your modem.<br> <br> The ability to print checks on your printer.<br><br> The ability to keep loan records and set up automatic loan payments.<br><br> The ability to import stock quotations to keep your brokerage accounts<br> up to date.  I know Managing Your Money can do this automatically<br> via modem.  Quicken probably can as well, but I'm not sure about it.<br><br> The ability to export tax information to popular tax preparation<br> programs.<br><br><br>Here are some features that I believe Managing Your Money has that<br>Quicken does not:<br><br> A tax prediction module.  This looks at your accounts and budget to<br> predict your tax liability for the coming year.  It's usefull to fine<br> tune your withholding so Uncle Sam doesn't get his due too early.<br><br> An insurance and vital records module.  This is a place to keep<br> records of your insurance policies as well as other vital records.<br> It can also compute your life expectancy.<br><br> A financial analysis module.  This computes compound interest, <br> effects of inflation, loan payments term or interest, yield to<br> maturity for bonds, savings account yields, days between dates, and<br> loan amortization schedules.  It also has functions to help you <br> decide whether to refinance your mortgage, whether you can afford<br> a particular home, whether a particular rental property is a good<br> investment, whether you should buy lease or rent, and whether<br> a particular investment's cash flow is adequate for your situation.<br> This module can also help you plan for retirement and for helping<br> your kids with their tuition.  <br><br> A net worth module.  This is a place to record all your assets<br> and liabilities.  Your net worth can be computed from this <br> information.  Any assets or liabilities recorded in other modules<br> are automatically included here.<br><br> A "desk" module.  This includes a small word processor, a card file<br> you can use to store names, addresses, phone numbers and other vital<br> information about friends and associates, a perpetual calander, a<br> rudimentary calculator, a to-do list, a reminder list, an appointment<br> list, and a place to record your phone calls (for those who need to<br> track such things).  Your appointments, reminders and to-do list<br> can be made to display automatically when you start the program.<br><br>There are probably some things listed above that Quicken has, but I'm almost<br>sure that Quicken doesn't do everything I've listed.  If I'm wrong, I'm sure<br>hordes of Quicken devotees will flame me to a crisp.<br><br>One thing that Quicken has that Managing Your Money does not yet have is a <br>Windows version.  MECA software is rumored to be working on a Windows version<br>of Managing Your Money for release late this year.

1	Our<br>camera images came out very good in my opinion.	The quality difference is very noticable and is almost worth the wait (for<br>the PS processing) - I'm rather impatient.<br><br>We were using it for B&W camera images (RS-170).  The gray scale image was<br>accepted by MS Word and handed to the Winjet PS printer driver which converts<br>the image into postscript and then hands it off to the Winjets postscript<br>processor.  The postscript is rendered into RAM (lots of it) and when it<br>is done it shoots it directly to the printer.  The PS processor can also<br>accept PS files created from other sources including DOS applications, but<br>Windows has to be running at the time of printing.  The PS processor is<br>responsible for the halftoning and I'd say it does a pretty good job.  Our<br>camera images came out very good in my opinion.  (not as good as Laser Master's<br>demo though).<br><br>I don't know how many other similar products are out there but I would be<br>surprised if there are several.
1	Obviously, since time<br>    is used as a position, you cannot get rid of this ridiculus waste <br>    of time.	<br><br>    The joystick reads in anolog values through a digital port. How?<br>    You send a command to the port to read it, then you time how long<br>    it takes for the joystick port to set a certain bit.  This time<br>    is proportional to the joystick position.  Obviously, since time<br>    is used as a position, you cannot get rid of this ridiculus waste <br>    of time.  If you wrote your own routine instead of the BIOS, it<br>    would speed it up some, but the time would still be there.<br><br>--

1	I also reviewed a new Nanao, the F550iW, which has just<br>been released.	<br><br><br>One of the monitors I reviewed for the June issue of Windows Magazine was<br>the Mitsubishi.  I also reviewed a new Nanao, the F550iW, which has just<br>been released.  Last year for the May '92 issue of Windows, I reviewed<br>several monitors, including the Nanao T560i.  There's no question that the<br>Nanao monitors are the best available this year, just as they were last<br>year.  The difference between my ranking of the best in Windows and the<br>ranking in Windows Sources is due mainly to a difference in the testing<br>criteria and the scoring.  I used different tests than they did, and I<br>scored differently.  There's nothing wrong with the Mitsubishi, and it<br>scored very highly in my tests, but it was a few points shy of perfect.<br><br>Incidentally, one of the things everyone should do when they're reading<br>reviews of any product, whether it's monitors or mice, is to read the<br>criteria and methodology carefully.  Unless you know how the product<br>testing was done, and on what the scores are based, you can't possibly<br>know what they really mean.  Just seeing that I rank a monitor differently<br>from Windows Sources is meaningless without knowing how we did the<br>ranking.  Likewise, it's impossible to tell whether a monitor will meet<br>your needs unless you know how we did the testing.  After all, some of<br>what we do may not apply to you.  Likewise, some of what we do may apply<br>more closely in one review than in another.  You can't always tell<br>anything from reading the 300 or so words of commentary we write if you<br>don't also understand the scoring.

1	Thank you for your time.	I have a problem with my floppy drives. In an effort to make my 3.5" drive <br>(normally b:) my a: drive, I switched the order of connections on the cable <br>from the serial card/floppy/ide controller. I booted up, changed the CMOS<br>settings to reflect the a: drive as the 3.5 and the b: drive as the 5.25.<br>The drive lights didn't come on, and there was a failure trying to read from<br>those drives.<br><br>I switched the cables back to their original positions, and then booted-up and<br>restored the original CMOS settings. The lights for the floppies came on<br>during this process, and they stay on for as long as the computer is on.<br>I see that when there is a disk in a:, the drive is spinning, yet there seems<br>to be no disk access. MSD.EXE and Norton SI detect both drives, but when I <br>try to get detailed information about a: or b:, Norton SI tells me that there<br>is no disk in the drive.<br><br>Can anyone offer any suggestions?<br>I'm in desperate need of help!!!<br><br>Thank you for your time.
1	But then most of the programs in MS-DOS are crap, such<br>as the PRINT command TSR that locks up your system for long periods of<br>time when the printer is full instead of trying every clock tick.	Unfortunately there a *LOT* of such software.  I also find it to be<br>the case that the majority of the software that is BAD in this regard<br>is COMMERCIAL software.  Way too many commercial packages are very<br>poorly written.  But then most of the programs in MS-DOS are crap, such<br>as the PRINT command TSR that locks up your system for long periods of<br>time when the printer is full instead of trying every clock tick.<br><br>Back to comm software... I find success with TELIX (my COM3 at 3e8/5<br>works ok on TELIX).

1	The cost of SCSI interface is a self fulliling<br>prophisy: few people buy SCSI because it is so expencive for the PC, which<br>in turn convices makes that mass producing SCSI {which would reduce its<br>cost} is unwarented, and so SCSI is expencive.	IBM<br>HD Interfaces {limited to hard drives by design or lack of development}:<br>[...]<br>IDE:  Integrated Device Electronics <br> currently the most common standard, and is mainly used for medium sized <br> drives. Can have more than one hard drive. Asynchronous Transfer: ~5MB/s max.<br><br>So at its LOWEST setting SCSI-2 interface in Asynchronous SCSI-1 mode AVERAGES <br>the through put MAXIMUM of IDE in asynchronous mode.  In full SCSI-2 mode<br>it blows poor IDE out the window, down the street, and into the garbage can.<br>The problem becomes can the drive mechanisim keep up with those through put<br>rates and THAT is where the bottleneck and cost of SCSI-2 comes from.  NOT<br>the interface itself but more and more from drive mechanisims to use the<br>SCSI-2 through put.  The cost of SCSI interface is a self fulliling<br>prophisy: few people buy SCSI because it is so expencive for the PC, which<br>in turn convices makes that mass producing SCSI {which would reduce its<br>cost} is unwarented, and so SCSI is expencive. {That is the effect of the<br>Rule of Scale: the more items sold the less EACH item has to bare the brunt<br>the cost of manufacture and so the less each item has to cost}

I said that this might be a silly question since I believe that<br>Micronics is a very well known motherboard manufacturer while I never<br>heard of Cache!

However, just in case<br>something went wrong, I'm going to describe some of the changes needed<br>to get Windows 3.1 working with the 1542.  Also, you may have noticed<br>that installing Windows 3.1 makes your PC run much slower, even when<br>you're not running Windows; methods of speeding it up are discussed in<br>the section called, "Windows 3.1 runs slowly".<br><br><br>* MSDOS configuration:<br><br>     The Windows install program adds the SmartDrive disk cache to your<br>CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files.  If you follow the instructions,<br>you'll notice that you'll need to use double-buffering with SmartDrive<br>(this is the default setup).  You'll also notice that your system runs<br>much, much slower -- in both Windows *AND* MSDOS.  See the section<br>called, "Windows 3.1 runs slowly", for some ways of speeding your system<br>up.<br><br><br>* Windows configuration:<br><br>     To get the Adaptec 1542 to work with Windows, make sure that the<br>"[388Enh]" section of the SYSTEM.INI file contains the entry:<br><br> VirtualHDIRQ=Off<br><br>I believe that the Windows install program automatically adds this entry<br>to SYSTEM.INI, but I'm not sure.  If this doesn't work for you, you<br>might want to try adding some more lines:<br><br> VirtualHDIRQ=Off<br> SystemROMBreakPoint=false<br> EMMExclude=A000-CFFF<br><br>(You probably don't need the above lines, though.)  The<br>"SystemROMBreakPoint" entry is used to enable support for memory<br>managers like QEMM/386MAX (only needed if you use such programs).<br><br><br>* Windows 3.1 runs slowly:<br><br>     Once you do get Windows 3.1 running with the 1542, chances are that<br>your system is running much slower than before.  If it's not, it's<br>probably because:<br><br>     1. You happen to be using ASPI4DOS.SYS version 3.1 in your<br> CONFIG.SYS file.  Congratulations -- this appears to be a<br> winning solution.<br><br>     2. You are very lucky.  Whether your luck will hold out remains to<br> be seen ....<br><br>If your system is running much slower than before, this is almost<br>definitely caused by Smartdrive with double-buffering.  According to the<br>Windows documentation, and the Microsoft technical note #Q81808<br>("SMARTDrive Double Buffering Required with ASPI4DOS.SYS"), you must use<br>Smartdrive with double-buffering enabled.  While this works, it really<br>slows down your PC; I once estimated that this slowed my PC down by a<br>factor of 5 (FIVE).  As I consider this unacceptable, I looked for other<br>solutions.<br><br>     Unfortunately, you cannot just disable double-buffering.  If you<br>do, Windows 3.1 in enhanced mode will not work, and you might even<br>destroy the contents of your hard disk by trying to run Windows 3.1.<br>What you can do is one of the following:<br><br>     1. Use other drivers that provide double-buffering.  It is my<br> opinion that the unbelievable slowness in Smartdrive is caused<br> either by horribly inefficient double-buffering, or by a bug in<br> Smartdrive.<br><br>     2. Use a driver that provides "VDS" services ("VDS" stands for<br> "Virtual DMA Services").  This is a standard, which is supported<br> by Windows 3.1, that allows bus-mastering disk controllers (like<br> the 1542) to work with Windows.<br><br>     After trashing my hard disk countless times, I found the following<br>solutions, none of which require using Smartdrive (note, however, that I<br>am now getting occasional parity errors, which are probably *NOT* caused<br>by these solutions, but might be -- see below).  While the following<br>does not require Smartdrive, using some kind of disk cache utility is<br>strongly recommended, as this makes Windows run much, much faster:<br><br>1. If you do not have the ASPI4DOS.SYS driver, or you do not need ASPI<br>   functions (for controlling a CDROM, tape drive, more than two<br>   physical hard disks, etc.), you can add the SCSIHA.SYS driver to your<br>   CONFIG.SYS file, e.g.:<br><br> DRIVER=c:\SCSIHA.SYS /V386<br><br>   (Windows needs the "/V386" option.)  This driver MUST be loaded into<br>   LOW memory (it cannot be loaded into high memory), and it occupies<br>   about 16-20K.  As of November 1992, the SCSIHA.SYS driver could be<br>   obtained from the Adaptec BBS at (408)-945-7727 (hopefully, it's<br>   still there).<br><br>2. If you need ASPI functions and have the ASPI4DOS.SYS driver, version<br>   3.0 or 3.0a, you can use both the ASPI4DOS.SYS and SCSIHA.SYS drivers<br>   in your CONFIG.SYS file, e.g.:<br><br> DRIVER=c:\ASPI4DOS.SYS<br> DRIVER=c:\SCSIHA.SYS /V386<br><br>   Amazingly enough, the SCSIHA.SYS driver can also be loaded high<br>   (assuming you have DOS 5.0); I would have thought that this would<br>   crash my system, but it doesn't.  I asked Adaptec's technical support<br>   about this, and they said that loading SCSIHA.SYS high should be fine<br>   as long as ASPI4DOS.SYS is loaded LOW.<br><br>   On my system, NOT using SCSIHA.SYS with ASPI4DOS 3.0a would<br>   occasionally cause Windows 3.1 to crash upon restarting or exiting<br>   Windows, with the additional result of a corrupted disk (some of my<br>   C:\WINDOWS\*.GRP files would be corrupted).  For me, these crashes<br>   usually occurred while making a different program from PROGMAN.EXE<br>   the default Windows shell, and vice-versa.  This is the reason<br>   SCSIHA.SYS may be necessary.<br><br>   I have absolutely no idea if SCSIHA.SYS is necessary with versions of<br>   ASPI4DOS earlier than 3.0.<br><br>   Note that many people can use ASPI4DOS 3.0 or 3.0a without<br>   SCSIHA.SYS; they do not seem to have any problems at all.  I consider<br>   these people lucky.  Others, like me, have had all sorts of problems.<br><br>3. In my opinion, the best, but not necessarily the easiest, solution is<br>   to upgrade to ASPI4DOS 3.1.  The SCSIHA.SYS driver is no longer<br>   needed.  Unfortunately, while you could get previous ASPI4DOS<br>   upgrades from the Adaptec BBS, the ASPI4DOS 3.1 driver is not<br>   available from the Adaptec BBS.  As far as I know, there are only<br>   three ways to get a copy:<br><br>      * You can buy the new (as of November 1992) Adaptec EZ SCSI driver<br> kit, which supposedly includes ASPI4DOS 3.1 as well as other<br> drivers, such as CDROM drivers.  I believe the list price is<br> around $75.<br><br>      * If you already have a copy of an older version of ASPI4DOS, you<br> can supposedly contact Adaptec to upgrade it to EZ SCSI for<br> around $30.<br><br>      * A copy of ASPI4DOS 3.1 is included in Central Point PC Tools 8.0<br> for MSDOS.  Note that the documentation and driver are stored in<br> different directories.  Note further that only ASPI4DOS is<br> included; the CDROM drivers and drivers to support more than two<br> hard disks are not included.  This is where I obtained my copy<br> of ASPI4DOS 3.1.<br><br>Note, however, that I am now getting occasional parity errors with<br>Windows.  In all probability, defective hardware in my PC is causing<br>this, as I upgraded my motherboard just after I found the above<br>solutions.  However, because these parity errors occur only during disk<br>accesses, there is a very small, but definite, possibility that the<br>parity errors are driver-related (for example, changing the bus on/off<br>timing for certain disk transfers might cause this).  I've run various<br>memory tests for hours at a time, and these tests have found no<br>problems.  This problem is probably caused by memory with marginal<br>timing requirements, which cause parity errors during disk transfers<br>(this is why the memory tests didn't find any problems -- the problems<br>show up only under disk I/O).  However, I'm mentioning this just in case<br>it isn't a hardware problem.<br><br><br>***** Floppy-controller-based tape backup devices:<br><br>     There are two possible problems with using the Adaptec 1542 with a<br>floppy-controller-based tape backup device, such as the Colorado Memory<br>Systems Jumbo 250:<br><br>1. Tape backups/restores can take a very long time.  The tape drive<br>   constantly starts, stops, starts, stops, etc.<br><br>2. Tape operations may be erratic, or encounter too many tape errors.<br>   (This problem might be caused by defective hardware on my 1542.<br>   However, I've heard of other people having similar problems, and so<br>   I'm mentioning this just in case it is not a hardware problem on my<br>   1542.)<br><br><br>* Tape backups/restores take a long time:<br><br>     If you have a floppy-controller-based tape backup device, you may<br>have to adjust the Adaptec 1540/1542 "bus on/off timing" for best<br>results when using the tape drive.  Normally, while doing a tape backup<br>or restore, the tape drive motor should be continuously running, with<br>only an occasional pause.  However, the default bus timing on the<br>Adaptec 1540/1542 may cause the tape drive motor to start and stop,<br>start and stop, every few seconds.  This causes needless wear to the<br>tape and tape drive (however, note that a dirty tape head or a defective<br>tape drive can also cause this -- make sure your tape heads are clean).<br>This also causes the tape backup or restore to take much, much longer<br>than necessary.<br><br>     The problem here is that these tape backups use the floppy DMA to<br>transfer data in memory to/from the tape drive, and the Adaptec uses DMA<br>to transfer data in memory to/from the hard disk.  The floppy DMA needs<br>to feed data to the tape drive at a certain rate; if the tape drive is<br>not fed data quickly enough by the floppy DMA, the tape drive stops,<br>rewinds a bit, and restarts (once enough data is eventually fed to it).<br>The default bus timing on the Adaptec (which is really DMA timing) is<br>"too large".  For example, when a backup is done, data has to be<br>transferred from a hard disk to memory, and then from memory to the<br>tape.  Because the default timing on the Adaptec "hogs" the memory too<br>much (too much time is spent transferring data from a hard disk to<br>memory), not enough time is spent transferring data from memory to the<br>tape drive.  As a result, the tape drive constantly starts and stops,<br>because data is not fed to it quickly enough.<br><br>     The solution is to change the Adaptec's bus on/off timing.  The<br>default factory setting is 11 microseconds on, and 5 microseconds off.<br>The "bus on" timing needs to be lowered to 2-4 microseconds.  This can<br>be done in one of two ways:<br><br>* If you have ASPI4DOS, you can use the "/n" option.  For example, I use<br>  a "bus on" timing of 4 microseconds, which means that I use the<br>  following line in my CONFIG.SYS file:<br><br> DEVICE=c:\aspi4dos.sys /n4<br><br>  Note that there is NO space between the "/n" and the "4".<br><br>* If you don't have ASPI4DOS, your only recourse is to try to find a<br>  program called "SETSCSI.EXE", which is very difficult to find.  The<br>  reason is that Adaptec, for reasons of their own, does not seem to<br>  want this widely distributed.  I once asked someone who worked for<br>  Adaptec, and they asked me to not upload it anywhere.  If you have<br>  anonymous ftp access to the Internet, you could try using archie to<br>  hunt down a copy; I believe that there are a couple of sites that have<br>  it.  If you do find a copy, you run it like so:<br><br> setscsi -n:4<br><br>  This adjusts the "bus on" timing to 4 microseconds.  Running<br>  SETSCSI.EXE without any arguments resets the bus timing back to the<br>  factory defaults.<br><br>  Note that it seems that you cannot use SETSCSI.EXE if you use<br>  ASPI4DOS; SETSCSI.EXE crashed my system if ASPI4DOS was loaded.  I<br>  could use SETSCSI.EXE with SCSIHA.SYS, however.<br><br>Do not lower the "bus on" timing below 2 microseconds, or increase it<br>above 11 microseconds.  If you lower it too low, the hard disk<br>throughput will suddenly drop; your system will feel slower.  For me, 4<br>microseconds works fine.  This value may work fine for you, or you may<br>have to adjust it downwards a little.<br><br>     Once you've lowered the "bus on" timing, tape backups and restores<br>should run faster.<br><br>     Also, do not experiment with the bus on/off times (with the other<br>options that I have intentionally not described), unless you know what<br>you are doing.  Bad combinations can cause parity errors and worse, by<br>starving memory refresh.<br><br>     A program called BUSTIFIX.EXE exists on the Adaptec BBS.  Unless<br>this has been upgraded since I last checked (which has been a while),<br>this is a self-extracting archive containing a batch file and a couple<br>of other files.  This batch file was supposed to allow one to set the<br>bus on/off times for the 1540/1542 and others.  However, when I tried<br>running this program with my 1542A, my system crashed.  At the time, I<br>was running SCSIHA.SYS, and I didn't check to see if there was a<br>conflict with it.  Maybe this old program works only with the 1542B,<br>although the docs say that it works with the 1542A?<br><br><br>* Erratic tape operations or too many tape errors:<br><br>     This "problem" may or may not exist.  Although it existed on my<br>system, a hardware problem just on my particular 1542 could cause it.<br>However, I've heard of other people having similar problems, and so I'm<br>mentioning this just in case it isn't a hardware problem just on my<br>1542.<br><br>     Symptoms of this "problem", which persists even after cleaning the<br>tape head:<br><br>1. Backing up to tape encounters "unusable sector detected" errors,<br>   resulting in an aborted tape backup.<br><br>2. Tape backup works, but the tape compare fails.<br><br>3. The tape drive starts, stops, starts, stops, etc. much too often.<br>   Unlike the above-mentioned problem ("Tape backups/restores take a<br>   long time"), where the tape drive starts and stops every few seconds,<br>   this kind of starting/stopping occurs every few 10-20 seconds or so.<br><br>4. Fastback Plus 3.1 does not find/see any tape backup devices.  Other<br>   programs, like Central Point Backup and the CMS Jumbo software<br>   (assuming that you have a CMS Jumbo 250 tape drive) can find/see the<br>   tape drive, but Fastback Plus 3.1 cannot.<br><br>5. Too many tape read errors.<br><br>     Although I do not know what is causing this problem, I discovered<br>that using a different floppy controller solves it.  A few months ago, I<br>upgraded my motherboard, which contained an integrated floppy<br>controller.  As I already had a floppy controller on the 1542, I<br>initially disabled the motherboard floppy controller.  After a while, I<br>decided to try disabling the 1542 floppy controller and using the one on<br>the motherboard.  When I did this, the tape drive (a CMS Jumbo 250)<br>reliability increased dramatically, and Fastback Plus 3.1 was suddenly<br>able to find and use the tape drive.<br><br>     I don't know if this was caused by a hardware problem on my 1542.<br>On the one hand, the floppy drives worked great when they were attached<br>to the 1542, which seems to say that there was nothing wrong with the<br>1542.  On the other hand, the tape drive didn't work well attached to<br>the 1542 floppy controller, but it did work when attached to a different<br>controller; this could be an indication of a hardware problem on my<br>1542.  I did change floppy drive cables, and so it is conceivable that<br>the problem was in the cables.  I don't know what the cause really is;<br>however, if you're having similar problems, you might want to consider<br>trying a new floppy controller.<br><br><br>***** Sound cards:<br><br>     Many popular sound cards can play or record digitized sound, and<br>this is typically done using DMA.  Like the tape drive DMA, the<br>Adaptec's DMA can conflict with the sound card DMA.  Unlike that of the<br>tape DMA, this "conflict" usually manifests itself as a parity error<br>(your system crashes with a parity error message).  What happens is<br>that, data is being transferred so quickly by the sound card and the<br>Adaptec, memory refresh cannot occur quickly enough, which causes a<br>parity error.  Usually, getting a parity error means that there is a<br>hardware problem with your system; in this case, however, the parity<br>error is not a symptom of bad hardware.<br><br>     I've found that such parity errors typically occur while recording<br>digitized sound, and the chances of such errors increase as you increase<br>the recording fidelity (e.g., higher sampling rate, recording in stereo,<br>recording using 16-bits instead of 8, etc.).<br><br>     Like the tape drive solution, the solution here is to lower the<br>Adaptec's "bus on" timing.  See the section on tape drives for<br>information on how this is done.  Note, however, that this may or may<br>not solve the problem; it may only reduce the probability of a parity<br>error.  The software used to record digitized sound can greatly affect<br>this problem (i.e., some software is inefficient).  Disk caches, the<br>speed of your hard disk, and the amount of disk fragmentation can also<br>affect this.<br><br><br>***** Miscellaneous info:<br><br>     This section contains miscellaneous hints, tips, and rumors.  Much<br>of it is merely information that I've heard or read about, and have not<br>verified.  I believe that the following information is correct, but I'm<br>not sure.  Use it at your own risk.<br><br>* With QEMM 6.00, 6.01, and 6.02, you need to specify the "DB="<br>  parameter (e.g., "DB=2"), unless you are using the ASPI4DOS driver.<br>  If you don't, QEMM will crash/hang at bootup.  Although the QEMM<br>  manual mentions this, the install program does not seem to detect that<br>  a 1542 is present and automatically add this option to the QEMM<br>  command line (at least, this occurred with the QEMM 6.00 install<br>  program -- I haven't tested any other version).  Earlier versions of<br>  QEMM probably need this parameter, but I'm not sure (I've never used a<br>  version earlier than 6.00).<br><br>  If you use ASPI4DOS, you do not need to give QEMM the "DB=" parameter.<br><br>* Some or all versions of the 1542 do not support hard disks over one<br>  gigabyte in size.  To support hard disks with capacities over 1GB, you<br>  need to get a new ROM BIOS from Adaptec.  I'm not sure if this is<br>  still true of the latest 1542Bs being sold by Adaptec.<br><br>* To connect a CDROM drive to the 1542, you need a SCSI CDROM drive and<br>  some drivers.  Note that some CDROM drives have proprietary interfaces<br>  (non-SCSI); these drives cannot be used with the 1542.  You have three<br>  choices for CDROM drivers (I have no idea how well the following<br>  solutions work, or even if they work -- the following is secondhand<br>  information):<br><br>     1. You can buy Adaptec's EZ SCSI driver package, which lists for<br> something like $75.  If you already have older Adaptec drivers,<br> you can supposedly upgrade to EZ SCSI for around $30.  Contact<br> Adaptec for details.  The EZ SCSI package supposedly contains<br> everything that you need.<br><br>     2. You can buy the CorelSCSI! driver package, which is made by the<br> same people that make CorelDRAW!  This package contains CDROM<br> drivers, SCSI tape drivers, WORM drivers, etc.  I do not know<br> the list price, but I've seen this package sold for around<br> $80-$90.  Note that CorelSCSI! does not come with the ASPI4DOS<br> driver, which is needed.  If you do not already have ASPI4DOS,<br> you may be better off getting Adaptec's EZ SCSI instead.<br><br>     3. [This method is obsolete, as the following drivers have been<br> obsoleted by Adaptec's EZ SCSI kit, but I'm mentioning it in<br> case someone already has these drivers.]  You can use the<br> drivers in the Adaptec ASW-1410 kit (ASPI4DOS) and the ASW-410<br> kit (ASPI CDROM drivers).  You will have to get a copy of<br> MSCDEX.EXE (a high-level CDROM driver), if it is not included in<br> the ASW-410 kit, but this is available from several bulletin<br> boards.<br><br>* To use a SCSI tape drive with the 1542, you need software that knows<br>  how to talk to a SCSI tape drive.  Software that I've heard about are<br>  (again, like the above section on CDROM drives, I have no idea how<br>  well the following solutions work, or even if they work -- the<br>  following is secondhand information):<br><br>     1. Central Point PC Tools 8.0 for MSDOS supposedly supports a large<br> number of SCSI tape drives.  It comes with SCSI drivers<br> (ASPI4DOS 3.1) as well as Central Point Backup.<br><br>     2. The CorelSCSI! driver package contains a SCSI tape backup<br> program (see the above section on CDROM drives for more<br> details).  However, note that CorelSCSI! does not come with, but<br> requires, ASPI4DOS.<br><br>* I've seen advertisements that sell the 1542 in three configurations:<br><br>     1. 1542 SCSI controller with hard disk ROM BIOS.<br>     2. 1542 SCSI controller w/BIOS and Adaptec ASPI drivers.<br>     3. 1542 SCSI controller w/BIOS, Adaptec ASPI drivers, and<br> CorelSCSI! drivers/programs.<br><br>  I imagine that Adaptec now sells the 1542 in a fourth configuration:<br><br>     4. 1542 SCSI controller w/BIOS and EZ SCSI drivers (including ASPI<br> drivers).<br><br>* Those people who use Unix might be interested in a version of GNU tar<br>  for MSDOS that talks to a SCSI tape drive via the ASPI4DOS driver (you<br>  need this driver before you can use this program).  I've never used<br>  this version of GNU tar, but I've heard that it works (I don't know<br>  how well, though).  If you have anonymous ftp access to the Internet,<br>  a copy can be found on wsmr-simtel20.army.mil and mirror sites:<br><br> PD1:<MSDOS.DSKUTL><br> ASPIBIN.ZIP  67841 920131 Gnu Tar for SCSI tape drives, Adaptec 154xx<br> ASPIPAT.ZIP  21206 920131 Patches for ASPIBIN relative to Gnu Tar 1.10<br> ASPISRC.ZIP 221370 920131 Src for Gnu Tar for SCSI tape, Adaptec ctrlr<br><br>  I have no idea if a copy can be found on Compuserve; UNIXFORUM might<br>  have it, if any forum does.<br><br>* As far as MSDOS is concerned, the 1542A and the 1542B controllers are<br>  the same; with MSDOS, the 1542A should work as well as the 1542B.<br>  However, the hardware for these two boards is not 100% identical, and<br>  there is at least one (NON-MSDOS) program that initially did not work<br>  with a 1542A, but did work with a 1542B (BSD386 -- a 386 version of<br>  BSD Unix).<br><br>* In case anyone's curious, here's an edited copy of my CONFIG.SYS file:<br><br> FILES=40<br> BUFFERS=40<br> BREAK=ON<br> STACKS=10,256<br> DEVICE=c:\sys\dev\aspi4dos.sys /d /n4<br> DEVICE=C:\QEMM\QEMM386.SYS on RAM ROM DMA=32 ST:M X=F800-FFFF<br> DOS=HIGH,UMB<br> DEVICEHIGH=c:\sys\dev\nnansi.sys<br> DEVICEHIGH=C:\DOS\SETVER.EXE<br> shell = c:\dos\command.com /p<br><br>  Note that I'm using QEMM and ASPI4DOS 3.1.  If I were using ASPI4DOS<br>  3.0 or 3.0a, I'd probably have to use a CONFIG.SYS that looked like:<br><br> FILES=40<br> BUFFERS=40<br> BREAK=ON<br> STACKS=10,256<br> DEVICE=c:\sys\dev\aspi4dos.sys /d /n4<br> DEVICE=C:\QEMM\QEMM386.SYS on RAM ROM DMA=32 ST:M X=F800-FFFF<br> DOS=HIGH,UMB<br> DEVICEHIGH=c:\sys\dev\scsiha.sys /V386<br> DEVICEHIGH=c:\sys\dev\nnansi.sys<br> DEVICEHIGH=C:\DOS\SETVER.EXE<br> shell = c:\dos\command.com /p<br><br>  If I weren't using ASPI4DOS, I'd probably use something that looked<br>  like:<br><br> FILES=40<br> BUFFERS=40<br> BREAK=ON<br> STACKS=10,256<br> DEVICE=c:\sys\dev\scsiha.sys /V386<br> DEVICE=C:\QEMM\QEMM386.SYS on RAM ROM DB=32 DMA=32 ST:M X=F800-FFFF<br> DOS=HIGH,UMB<br> DEVICEHIGH=c:\sys\dev\nnansi.sys<br> DEVICEHIGH=C:\DOS\SETVER.EXE<br> shell = c:\dos\command.com /p<br><br>  However, if I used a floppy-controller-based tape drive, or if I<br>  planned to record high-quality sound from a sound card, I would still<br>  need some way of changing the Adaptec's bus on/off times.  The first<br>  two versions of CONFIG.SYS take care of this, but this last version<br>  doesn't.<br><br>

1	Someone said that it really takes 3 clock cycles to<br>perform a transfer, so that reduces the transfer rate to 5.5MB/s,<br>which is the commonly-used figure for ISA bus speed.	Well, some quick math on my part shows that an 8.3MHz bus, 16 bits<br>wide, performing a transfer every two clock cycles will provide 8.3M<br>bytes/sec.  Someone said that it really takes 3 clock cycles to<br>perform a transfer, so that reduces the transfer rate to 5.5MB/s,<br>which is the commonly-used figure for ISA bus speed.  However, I<br>believe a two-clock transfer is possible (0 wait states).

Diamond was helpful when I finally reached the "right" person in curing<br>some of my Windows' problems due to an address conflict.  The conflicting<br>addresses (2E0, 2E8) were OMITTED in at least my version of the<br>Diamond/VRAM manual.  I hope it has been corrected by now.  The tech rep<br>explained that ALL S3-based boards use these addresses.  I have not<br>confirmed the validity of that statement.<br><br>When I upgrade my motherboard in the near future (hopefully with some<br>form of local bus), I'll seek a video solution from someone other than<br>Diamond.<br><br>Lance Hartmann (lance%hartmann.austin.ibm.com@ibmpa.awdpa.ibm.com)<br>               Yes, that IS a '%' (percent sign) in my network address.

When I use the terminal software for Windows such as TERMINAL.EXE or <br>Crossttalk, it doesn't use the whole window.  I mean, when the software's<br>window size is max, it still scrolls around the 2/3 of window.  It does not<br>use whole window.  I set "stty rows 30", but still the same. Scrolls at 2/3<br>from the top of the windows.  Could anyone tell me how to setup these software<br>to use whole window?

1	2.	I'm looking at purchasing some sort of backup solution.  After you read about<br>my situation, I'd like your opinion.  Here's the scenario:<br><br>1.  There are two computers in the house.  One is a small 286 (40MB IDE drive).<br>    The other is a 386DX (213 SCSI drive w/ Adaptec 1522 controller).  Both <br>    systems have PC TOOLS and will use Central Point Backup as the backup / <br>    restore program.  Both systems have 3.5" and 5.25" floppies.<br><br>2.  The computers are not networked (nor will they be anytime soon).<br><br>From what I have seen so far, there appear to be at least 4 possible<br>solutions (I'm sure there are others I haven't thought about).  For these <br>options, I would appreciate hearing from anyone who has tried them or sees <br>any flaws (drive type X won't coexist with device Y, etc.) in my thinking <br>(I don't know very much about these beasts):<br><br>1.  Put 2.88MB floppy drives (or a combination drive) on each system.<br>    Can someone supply cost and brand information?  What's a good brand?<br>    What do the floppies themselves cost?<br><br><br>2.  Put an internal tape backup unit on the 386 using my SCSI adapter, and<br>    continue to back up the 286 with floppies.  Again, can someone recommend a<br>    few manufacturers?  The only brand I remember is Colorado Memories.  Any<br>    happy or unhappy users (I know about the compression controversy)?<br> <br><br>3.  Connect an external tape backup unit on the 386 using my SCSI adapter, and<br>    (maybe?) connect it to the 286 somehow (any suggestions?)<br><br><br>4.  Install a Floptical drive in each machine.  Again, any gotcha's or <br>    recommendations for manufacturers?  <br><br>I appreciate your help.  You may either post or send me e-mail.  I will<br>summarize all responses for the net.<br><br>Thanks,
0	Oh yeah, MS Word for Windows converts everything flawlessly but for what<br>I'm looking for that's like using a tank to crack walnuts.	Everything works peachey keen as long as the author of the message has<br>maintained his text at 80 col. max. width.

0	And if anyone at Microsoft is reading this -- I really love your products.	Well, someone at Microsoft told you wrong.  Windows will use a swap file<br>larger than the recommended size.  Last summer I went to a Microsoft<br>Windows 3.1 Technical Workshop and they distributed A LOT of information<br>that the general public might not be aware of.  Anyway in the main book<br>they handed out they have a section on "Creating larger than recommended<br>swapfile".  I'll quote the information<br><br>  If you create a permanent swapfile larger than the recommended size, you<br>  will receive a message telling you that Windows will not use anything<br>  larger than the recommended size.  THIS ERROR MESSAGE IS INCORRECT, we<br>  will allow the use of the larger swapfile, up to four times the amount<br>  of RAM on your machine.<br><br>So as you see, Microsoft does know that the information is incorrect.  You<br>probably just ran into some doofball who was new on the job and was only<br>telling you what little he knew.<br><br>Be that what it may, I would really suggest to everyone to take the<br>opportunity to go to these Technical Workshops.  They aren't actually<br>incredibly in-depth, but you do get a lot of material about bugs and<br>optimization straight from those in the know.  Besides that they offer<br>you HUGE discounts on software.  If I remember correctly, you could pick<br>up Word 2.0, Excel 4.0, or whatever their presentation program is for $130.<br>That is the full blown version, not an upgrade or educational version.  You<br>could also pick up Microsoft Office for $500 or something like that.  Myself<br>I sprang for Word.<br><br>Well, hope that was helpful to someone.

However, I think a different relationship will <br>arise: NT will be the server (*N*etowrk *T*echonology), Chicogo will be the <br>client machine.

1	These are the marker holes which let the tape drive know when it is <br>at the end of the tape.	Did you open up the tape cartridge and put the tape back on the reels?<br><br>If you have not yet, open it up by removing the two screws on the bottom of<br>the tape cartridge and snap the plastic shell away from the metal base.  <br>As you are pulling the tape through the assembly try not to touch any more <br>than you have to.  As you are doing it, look for a couple of little holes in <br>the tape.  These are the marker holes which let the tape drive know when it is <br>at the end of the tape.  The holes are spaced a couple of inches apart.  My best<br>guess is that the drive finds the first marker and then stops on the second<br>marker?  <br><br>Anyhow, If the tape has the holes, then check to see if the mirror on the tape<br>is clean.  The function of the mirror is to detect the marker holes.  The<br>tape drive shines a light at the mirror and has a pickup in the area where<br>the reflection would come out.  When the hole goes by, the pickup detects the <br>light that was allowed to pass and it knows when to stop.  If the mirror is dirty<br>or out of alighment (unlikely since it is made into the case) you might have<br>a problem detecting the end of the tape.<br><br>If the tape drive does it on all tapes and the tapes all look good, then either<br>the pickup or the LED of the sensor system has failed or is dirty.  If you open<br>the drive door you will see the sensor assembly to the left of the R/W head<br>assembly.  If it looks clean and nothing is in its way, then the drive may<br>need to be serviced.  It is possible that the LED is burned out or the sensor<br>is out. <br><br>If it is still in warranty, you might be able to send it back to CMS for<br>repair.<br><br><br>---<br>Scott Hiles<br>whiles@relay.nswc.navy.mil
1	The floppy, on the other hand, is not buffered, so that using the CPU<br>for floppy data transfer (as was done on the PC Jr, by the way) really<br>does stink.	Actually, it does make a reasonable amount of sense. Fixed disk<br>sectors are buffered by the controller, and transferring them to<br>memory with a 'rep insw' (or whatever the instruction is called) is<br>quite efficient (single instruction, goes as fast as the<br>controller/cpu know how to use the bus). Since the 286 wasn't cached,<br>the bus is likely a critical resource relative to CPU performance, and<br>it's possible that DMA bus interference would cause as much or more<br>loss of CPU cycles (for 'computing') as does the 'rep insw' sequence.<br><br>The floppy, on the other hand, is not buffered, so that using the CPU<br>for floppy data transfer (as was done on the PC Jr, by the way) really<br>does stink.

A controller that allows reselection can operate<br>even better with multiple devices.  This is espically true with SCSI tape<br>units.  For example, when rewinding or formatting a tape, the command is<br>issued to the controller and the bus is released to allow access to other<br>devices on the bus.  This greatly increases productivity or, at least, do<br>something else while backing up your hard drive :-).

0	Can't they just admit that<br>    their benchmark is to easy to optimize for and/or cheat on?	Two things that annoyed me about the PC Magazine review:<br><br>1.  Their benchmarking technique is seriously flawed, as was clearly shown<br>    by the Graphite and #9GXE's "cheating".  Can't they just admit that<br>    their benchmark is to easy to optimize for and/or cheat on?  WinTach<br>    is much harder to beat...<br><br>2.  The big "cheat" that Hercules/IIT used was overlappipping BitBlit and<br>    PolyLine optimization, and Hercules sent them a new driver which didn't<br>    do this -- but produced almost identical scores.  Yet, the only thing<br>    PC Magazine says is that scores are not "legitimate" -- couldn't they<br>    at least make some comment about its real-world performance?<br><br>I'm not so much going by WinBench for performance, but, rather, by Steve<br>Gibson's results, which are more real-world based (like using Micrografx<br><br>    "Despite these documented cheats, I have to say that in real-world<br>     applications the Hercules Graphite adapter actually draws faster than<br>     any other display adapter in the industry.   [...]  Even though it's<br>     just a modest ISA bus card, it outperformed every local bus adapter I<br>     have, including the Stealth 24 VLB, the Fahrenheit 1280VA/VLB, the<br>     ATI VLB Mach32 and even the Weitek P9000-based Diamond Viper VLB."<br><br>This kind of praise is enough for me to be interested in it, bogus WinBench<br>or not!  :)<br><br><br>I already returned the ATI GU+.  My dealer had sold eight of them, and <br>seven were returned to him.  I'm now (temporarily) back to running an<br>original ATI GU, until I get my Graphite.  And, yes, the GU is faster in<br>my 16 MB system than the GU+, especially in bitmap handling (that's where<br>you use BitBlits).<br><br>Hercules has a promotion available for VARs and software developers: you<br>can buy one Graphite or Graphite VLB for 50% off list to try it out.  At<br>just $199 for Graphite or $249 for the VLB version I decided it was worth<br>trying (I'm supposed to get the VLB board within two weeks).  I'll post<br>my impressions when I get it...<br>

0	I am sure there are other problems along the same lines, but I have<br>not encountered them (yet).	I have never gotten the _entire_ ctrltest app to run under BC++, but<br>the reason is that MS makes some bad assumptions about the order in<br>which static/global objects are initialized (i.e. some objects are<br>getting accessed before they are initialized).  The problem is in the<br>owner-draw menu code somewhere-- if you comment out that section, all<br>other pieces of ctrltest work fine.<br><br>Two other major gotchas I have found using MFC under BC++:<br><br>- The CFile::OpenFlags enum uses hard-coded numbers for the open mode,<br>  rather than the manifest constants defined in fcntrl.h (which differ<br>  between MSC and BC).<br><br>- All of the MFC collection classes depend on another bad C++<br>  assumption-- that a reference to a base object can used be in place<br>  of a reference to a derived object (true for pointers, NOT for<br>  references).<br><br>I am sure there are other problems along the same lines, but I have<br>not encountered them (yet).

1	I think we go to AT LEAST 76 Hz at 1024x768x8, and maybe more (and<br>it's a function of the RAMDAC speed, not the Power 9000).	This is not the case: the ROM on the P9000 supports VESA modes of up to<br>1024x768 in 256 colors.  VESA-compliant applications should have no trouble<br>setting these modes. (But I'm forwarding your posting to our Software group,<br>just in case.  Can't be too careful.)  Not that I doubt that YOUR applications<br>are failing to run; lots of stuff depends on figuring out which exact SVGA<br>they're looking at, and don't use VESA calls (VESA is still pretty new).<br>Every new chip set confuses them.<br><br><br>I think we go to AT LEAST 76 Hz at 1024x768x8, and maybe more (and<br>it's a function of the RAMDAC speed, not the Power 9000). We need to<br>fix the problems you've noted (they were already on the list).  If<br>you're really interested, though, take a look at the text file<br>P9000RES.DAT, which holds the data from which the choices in the<br>P9000 monitor installation program are built.  Working by analogy,<br>you can build up a new monitor definition that has the right<br>combinations of refresh rates for your monitors.  Keep a backup copy<br>of the file!  Once you've built a new version of the P9000RES.DAT<br>file, run the P9000 installation program, INST, and your new choices<br>should show up.  (This assumes you have the WEITEK v. 2.2 drivers.<br>You can tell the rev number by looking at the modification time of<br>the driver: 02:20 is version 2.20.  Microsoft uses this gimmick,<br>too.)<br><br><br>The SPEEDY benchmark was put out by Hercules and IIT, who to my<br>knowledge were unencumbered by any motivations except making the<br>Hercules Graphite/IIT AGX014 card look really good.  So I'd take the<br>numbers with a ton of salt. (Texas Instruments did the same thing<br>with WINTACH, trying to make the 34020 look good compared to the<br>8514, as if anyone cared.)  It's safer (though not safe) to use<br>benchmarks from "unbiased" sources, such as testing labs, columnists,<br>etc.<br><br><br><br>I think you'll a large discrepancy between the results of SPEEDY and<br>the results of anything else in the universe on these things.<br><br><br>Font caching is a perfectly legitimate optimization -- Windows has<br>hooks for it built right into the GDI.  What's kind of silly is IIT's<br>use of a hardwired "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog then<br>sat on a tack" string in their driver.  Not only is it useless in<br>real applications, it lacks the programming elegance of the "Bart<br>Simpson optimization," in which you save the bitmap of the<br>most-recently drawn string in off-screen memory, and just do a<br>screen-to-screen bitblit if you happen to be given that same string a<br>second time in a row.  (We call it the "Bart Simpson optimization"<br>because Bart's the only person we can see benefiting from it: he<br>could right "I will not cheat on benchmarks" a hundred times and be<br>done in half the time it would take to actually form each character.)<br><br><br>We don't have any lawyers -- they're all working for Intel.

Ok once again with the SCSI spec list:<br>SCSI-1 {with a SCSI-1 controler chip} synchronous range is indeed 0-5MB/s<br> asynchronous range is slower at 0-3MB/s.<br>SCSI-1 {With a SCSI-2 controller chip}: 4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst {8-bit}<br> Note the INCREASE in SPEED, the Mac Quadra uses this version of SCSI-1<br> so it DOES exist. Some PCs use this set up too.<br><br>SCSI-2 {8-bit/SCSI-1 mode}:          4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst<br>{for those who want SCSI-2 but don't want to pay for the 16-bit or 32-bit<br> hardware or mess with the SCSI-2 software controllers.  Usable by SCSI-1<br> devices with close to 8-bit SCSI-2 speeds}<br>SCSI-2 {16-bit/wide or fast mode}:  8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst<br>SCSI-2 {32-bit/wide AND fast}:     15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst<br><br>On the other interfaces let DXB132@psuvm.psu.edu speak:<br>Again synchronous and asynchronous modes with asynchronous much slower<br> {Range 0-5MB/s}<br><br>One problem is the inconsitant use of the term 'SCSI' in articles and by<br>people.  Its PROPER meaning is "The set of SCSI interfaces composed of<br>SCSI-1 AND SCSI-2"<br>Look at the inconsitant use of SCSI in the below quote:<br>(My comments in {})<br><br>PC Magazine April 27, 1993:29 "Although SCSI is twice as fast as ESDI,<br>{This is asynchronous SCSI-1 with a SCSI-1 chip} 20% faster than IDE..."<br>{this is BOTH asynchronous SCSI-1 with a SCSI-2 chip AND 8-bit SCSI-2}<br>To read CONSITANTLY the quote SHOULD read:<br>{asynchronous SCSI-1 with a SCSI-1 chip}<br>"Although asynchronous SCSI-1 is twice as fast as ESDI, one third the <br>speed of IDE..."<br>or {asynchronous SCSI-1 with a SCSI-2 chip or 8-bit SCSI-2}<br>"Although SCSI-1 with a SCSI-2 chip and 8-bit SCSI-2 are eight times as fast as<br>ESDI, 20% faster than IDE..."<br><br>NOTE the NONUSE of 'SCSI' by itself.  This eliminates ambaguity.<br><br>SCSI-1 drivers are somewhat reasonable while 16-bit and 32-bit SCSI-2 drivers <br>are VERY expansive {8-bit SCSI-2 can use SCSI-1 drivers with little speed<br>degridation(the Mac Quadra does EXACTLY this.)}
0	In the last PC-Magazine they benchmarked some of the new accelerators,<br>and admitted that many of them 'cheated' on WinBench.	And why they are considering using WinBench as a test, they may want<br>to read everything Steve Gibson has said on the subject in his<br>InfoWorld column the past couple of month.  In short, virtually<br>every board manufacturer cheats on the test by writing things in the<br>driver that is there only to make the board appear faster on the<br>WinBench suite.  So the WinBench score has no bearing in reality to<br>how cards stack up on real world tasks.<br><br>In the last PC-Magazine they benchmarked some of the new accelerators,<br>and admitted that many of them 'cheated' on WinBench.  Interestingly,<br>they 'allowed' one type of cheating behaviour (caching for bitblt<br>operations, no matter how unreal), yet did not allow a couple of other<br>types of cheating behaviour that some of the cards used.  At least<br>one card was eliminated from the "Editor's Choice" because of<br>cheating on the benchmark.
1	Originally, the drive in the machine<br>had none.	The first drive is currently formatted to Tandy Dos v3.3 but I am eventually<br>going to upgrade both to MS Dos v 5.0<br><br>The drives themselves are both model number WD95044-A circa 5-07-1991<br>They are 782 cyl 4 head drives.  A note to add is that there is no exact<br>configuration for these in my current bios, but it seems to work at a<br>setting 17 (977 cyl 5 head, 300 write_pre, 977 landing zone).<br>There are three pairs of jumper pins on the back that I presume are<br>for setting up the master/slave.  Originally, the drive in the machine<br>had none.  Currently, I was suggested to try the far right (looking at the<br>back) for master and the middle jumper for the slave.<br><br>When booted, the reinitialize seems to puke accessing the d: drive.  It does<br>flicker about three times on the second drive, but then gives the error.  <br>Hopefully the problem is as simple as the drive not being formatted, but not<br>being a person who has ever had to actual format and unformatted drive, I<br>would not even know how to do that.<br><br>Any and all help on this is great fully appreciated.

1	I haven't<br>tried this, but that would be my guess...<br><br>    Robert Anisko<br>    anisko@usdtsg.daytonoh.ncr.com<br>	   You might try asking on one of the comp.sys.ibm.* echos (the best one<br>may be comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware).  I say this because the conversion<br>seems more geared toward a PC user wanting to use that monitor, than<br>an Atari user who already can use the monitor (unless maybe they<br>want to really go wild - converting the monitor to VGA, then<br>using it as a VGA monitor with a Falcon :-)<br><br>   As for graphics cards, assuming that the Atari monitor can be<br>modified/adapted to handle VGA signals, you should probably be able<br>to use any VGA card (at least with a res around 640x400).

1	To anybody who replies to this-- Thanks in advance.

0	Does anybody uses this two programs together?	We are having troubles using the PC/TCP onpredir (printer redirection program<br>with lpr support) with the Windows print manager.

This is due to the protocal the takes place between the two drives <br>when performing diagnostics.<br>   There are four links, LK1, LK2, LK4 and LK5, adjacent to the 40 way <br>interface connector. They have the following functions and are described <br>in order as viewed from the end of the drive, with the first jumper <br>described nearest the 40 way interface connector.<br><br>LK2: LED <br>     When fitted, this jumper connects the LED drive to pin 39 of the<br>     interface. This allows a LED to be connected to the interface. An<br>     external current limiting resistor needs to be fitted in series with<br>     the LED when this option is selected. The value of the resistor will<br>     be dependant on the LED type chosen but will be in the range of 130<br>     Ohms ot 220 Ohms.<br><br>LK1: Dual Drives<br>     This jumper must be fitted when two drives are attached to a single<br>     bus. It fallows communication across the 40 way interface connector,<br>     indicating, to the Master drive, the presence of a Slave.<br><br>LK4: Master<br>     When fitted this signifies that the drive jumpered is a Master. If<br>     there are two drives connected on a single bus then only one may be<br>     jumpered in this way.<br><br>LK5: IOChRdy<br>     When fitted this connects the IOChRdy signal to the drive, it is <br>     fitted when the drive is used in host systems that have a higher<br>     data transfer rate than the drive i.e. greater than 4 MBytes per<br>     second when using 1:1 interleave. This jumper is not normally <br>     fitted as most hosts transfer at a lower rate than 4 MBytes per<br>     second.<br><br>   There are four possible Master/Slave configurations in which a drive(s)<br>may be jumpered:<br><br>     Master, single drive with LED on interface  LK2 & LK4 fitted.<br>     Master, single drive without LED on interface LK4 only fitted.<br>     Master, dual drive without LED on interface LK4 & LK1 fitted.<br>     Slave, dual drive without LED on interface  No jumpers fitted.<br>     Master, dual drive with LED on interface  LK4, LK1 & LK2 fitted.<br>     Slave, dual drive with LED on interface  LK2 only fitted.<br><br>   The Master drive will delay power-up for approximately two seconds to<br>reduce power surges in applications where dual drives are used.<br><br>   The other connections for a LED will be found close to the 28 way <br>connector at the other end of the drive. This LED driver is not affected<br>by the link options. An internal current limiting resistor is on the <br>drive for this LED driver.

Someone will likely write a telnetd for it so<br>one could run character-based apps, but graphics-based apps will have<br>to be shared by running the executables on the local CPU. This is how<br>things are shaping up everywhere: client-server architectures are<br>taking over from the old cpu-terminal setups. <br><br>Note that the NeXT does this: you can always telnet into a NeXT and<br>run character-based apps but you can't run the GUI.

1	I'm currently thinking about adding another HD, in the 300Mb to 500Mb range.	[Tons of stuff deleted on SCSI vs. IDE question...]<br><br>Wow, you guys are really going wild on this IDE vs. SCSI thing, and I think<br>it's great!<br><br>Like lots of people, I'd really like to increase my data transfer rate from<br>the hard drive.  Right now I have a 15ms 210Mb IDE drive (Seagate 1239A), and<br>what I would say is a standard (not special, no cache I believe) IDE controller<br>card on my ISA 486-50.<br><br>I'm currently thinking about adding another HD, in the 300Mb to 500Mb range.<br>And I'm thinking hard (you should hear those gears a-grinding in my head)<br>about buying a SCSI drive (SCSI for the future benefit).  I believe I'm getting<br>something like 890Kb/sec transfer right now (according to NU).  How would this<br>number compare if I bought the state-of-the-art SCSI card for my ISA PC, and<br>the state-of-the-art SCSI hard drive (the wailing-est system I could hope for)?<br>Obviously money factors into this choice as well as any other, but what would<br>YOU want to use on your ISA system? And how much would it cost?<br><br>Along those lines, what kind of transfer rate could I see with my IDE HD's if I<br>were to buy the top-of-the-line IDE caching controller for my 200Mb, 15ms HD?<br>And how much would it cost?<br><br>I actually have a PAS-16, and could (what a waste I guess it would be...) hook<br>up a SCSI HD through it's SCSI port which yields an optimum of 690Kb/sec.<br>Actually, I have a borrowed 12ms Fujitsu HD hooked up through it now (and<br>own the Trantor HD drivers for the PAS-16 SCSI port).  Is this SCSI port a<br>SCSI-2 port?  How could I tell?  Is the Fujitsu 2623A a SCSI-2?  Are all SCSI<br>HD's SCSI-2?<br><br>Thanks for any comments on these rephrased questions.
0	Otherwise, the default value is the /e: option in the<br>SHELL= command in CONFIG.SYS.	    CommandEnvSize=NNNN<br><br>"This sets the COMMAND.COM env size, where NNNN must either be 0 or<br>between 160 and 32768.  A value of 0 disables the setting.  If this<br>value is too small or too big, it is rounded up to 160 or down to 32768.<br>If the value is less than the current size of the actual environment,<br>this setting is disabled, as if it were 0.  If you specify the<br>environment size in a PIF file for COMMAND.COM, the PIF setting<br>overrides this setting.  The default is 0 with MSDOS versions earlier<br>than 3.2.  Otherwise, the default value is the /e: option in the<br>SHELL= command in CONFIG.SYS.  To set this value, you must edit your<br>SYSTEM.INI [and reboot]."<br><br><br>I have used this entry, as well as relied on the default /e: from<br>the CONFIG.SYS shell= line, and both give larger environments.  If<br>you don't use one of these, then the environment passed by windows<br>to each new DOS box is just a little bit bigger than the environment<br>_variables_ present when windows was started.  (No matter how big<br>the DOS env was, when windows starts, it truncates all unused space<br>except for a few bytes.)  This should allow your batch file to run,<br>but your mileage may vary.<br>

The one thing that I was puzzled by was why there was not a<br>1024x768x32k color mode on the thing, either in full screen or<br>enlarged desktop mode.  My ATI Ultra Plus can handle that, given 2MB<br>of memory.  All the 2MB buys you on the Fahrenheit is 1280x1024x256.<br>Just ONE more mode.  GEEZ.  Had I known, I wouldn't have bothered.  I<br>asked them why, and all I got was "Your point is well taken, but<br>Orchid's software developers are busy with other projects."<br><br> So, to get to the point, finally, ARE there any s3 86c805<br>drivers out there that can handle high res hicolor modes?  I'd love to<br>get another card, but perhaps it will have to wait until the next<br>generation of cards comes out, since this card came bundled with my<br>system and it's not so easy to exchange these things unless they're<br>broken.<br><br> If you want these modes, steer away from Orchids s3 86c805<br>cards (ie.

If the magazines are to believed, I've only seen one s3 86c805<br>product thus far which can handle 1024x768x32k color (Genoa?),<br>although evenn that might be a misprint.<br><br> Please, if there are generic or semi-generic drivers out<br>there, let me know where I can get them.  800x600x32k is OK, but I<br>coulda gotten that with my ATI VGA Wonder XL.
0	If any changes are required, or a new version is released, complete<br>   the above procedures again.	WSM is a compilation of submissions from shareware/freeware authors in a single<br>Windows .HLP (Help System) file.  All types of software may be submitted for<br>entry in WSM - utilities, applications, games, programming tools, etc.<br><br>WSM benefits Windows shareware/freeware authors by allowing them to publicize<br>their software releases, inform users of updated versions, and to increase<br>their installed base of users.  Those searching for specific Windows software<br>will benefit by having a complete list of available software available at their<br>fingertips - complete with feature lists, current prices, and any other<br>relevant information.<br><br>Windows software authors may submit entries to Windows Shareware Monthly in the<br>following manner:<br><br>1. Compose a short summary of the function of the software.  Include all<br>   special features which are unique to your product and which set it apart<br>   from other programs in the genre.  Be sure to include specific details<br>   such as: the current release version, where the software is available,<br>   how much the registration fee costs, how much disk space is required, any<br>   special requirements (e.g. sound card, or VBRUN200.DLL, etc.), how the<br>   author may be contacted, etc.  Because text is highly compressible, the<br>   summary may be as long as is necessary, however, it is best to keep it<br>   short.  A good guideline is a single screenful of 12-point text at 640x480<br>   resolution.  Order forms and other such addendum may be included if desired.<br>   All submissions whould be in plain text (ASCII) format.  Formatting will<br>   be exactly as it is submitted - I will simply cut and paste text files<br>   into a Help Authoring system.  If you require special formatting <br>   conventions - such as boldface text or italics, or a larger font size,<br>   indicate so CLEARLY within the text file.  For best results, use Windows<br>   NotePad to create the .TXT file. <br> <br>2. Include up to 100k of Windows-format .BMP (bitmap) screen-shots which<br>   display the workings or special features of each program.  Special cases<br>   (rendering applications for example) which require 256-color bitmaps may<br>   submit up to 250k of .BMP files - all other should observe the 100k limit<br>   and use 16-color format.  For maximum compatiblity with the software which<br>   will be used to create the WSM .HLP file (Stefan Olson's Help Writer's<br>   Assistant for Windows), please save the bitmaps with Windows Paintbrush or<br>   WinGIF. <br><br>3. Include a 16-color .BMP of the program's icon (.ICO file).  Many programs<br>   are available to convert .ICO to .BMP format, or Windows Paintbrush may be<br>   used.  The .BMP will be embedded in the summary text.<br><br>4. Double-check for spelling errors, formatting corrections, etc.  <br><br>5. Compress the .TXT file, the .BMP of the program icon, and any additional<br>   .BMPs into a single file using PKZIP (any version).<br><br>6. Submit the entry by UUENCODING the .ZIPfile, and e-mailing it to:<br>   <br>   DAA7365@TAMUTS.TAMU.EDU<br><br>   if submitting via the Internet or Compuserve. If submitting via America<br>   Online, send a brief message indicating submission, and append the .ZIP<br>   file, then e-mail to:<br><br>   DiegoAA<br><br>7. If any changes are required, or a new version is released, complete<br>   the above procedures again.  Send all submissions to the @TAMUTS address,<br>   and any comments, suggestions, criticisms, to DAA7365@RIGEL.TAMU.EDU.<br><br>All entries received before the deadline will be included in the subsequent<br>edition of WSM.  The editor will not be held responsible for any errors, and<br>we reserve the right to make changes to the entries.<br><br>WSM is not limited to shareware/freeware software.  A special area will be<br>devoted to commercially available Windows 3.x and NT software.  Commercial<br>software authors should follow the same steps above, with the exception of<br>the limitations on size - the .TXT file and .BMPs may be as large as required<br>(and as large as is practical for transmission over phone lines).  There<br>is no charge for the publishing of either shareware/freeware or commercial<br>product entries.  <br><br>Advertisements for computer hardware, software, bulletin boards, etc. may<br>be submitted as well. Again, the same procedures apply, with the exception of<br>the size limitations.  There is no charge for advertising space.  The first<br>ten advertisements submitted each month will be included; subsequent<br>submissions will not be included due to size constraints.<br><br>WSM is currently looking for persons willing to devote the time to author<br>columns within WSM.  A C/C++ programing section, a Visual Basic section, and<br>two Windows-specific opinion/advice columns are envisioned.  All work will<br>be on a voluntary basis.

0	There is no reason why one cannot write a posix based shell like<br>csh on Unix for remote logins.	It certainly is multi-user. What I have seen from the March Beta is<br>that it doesn't yet come with the stuff which exploits multi-user<br>features. I remember somebody from MS stating that it doesn't allow<br>two users share one GUI. My interpretation of this was that one user<br>per console but all the networking and RPC based stuff you want. <br><br>I believe ftp and rlogin deamons for NT systems will come from third<br>party. Somebody already has a Beta version of an unsecure ftpd on the<br>net. There is no reason why one cannot write a posix based shell like<br>csh on Unix for remote logins. <br><br>In general I liked NT when I checked it out. It slow compared to<br>Win3.1 (just like any other real OS). The beta version, although being<br>slow, botts up much faster than my SUN workstation. Windows subsystems<br>also start up a lot faster than X windows. I believe Bill Gates was<br>right when he stated that NT was not for everybody. After playing<br>around with it for a while I was convinced. If I owned a busines using<br>a "business computer" from IBM or some other established vendor, I<br>would consider moving to NT platform because it would provide a much<br>cheaper solution (If you are running SQL servers etc.). It provides<br>the robustness such an application requires. <br><br>On the other hand if you like your DOS games, more or less forget<br>about NT. You can always boot to DOS  but in general that defeats<br>the purpose of using NT. Most of NT's features are visible in a<br>networked environment and in such an environment you can't reboot your<br>machine at will. For personal use, I would rather wait for the Win32<br>based Windows release (whatever you name it) than jump to NT bandwagon.<br>I expect most applications will keep on using Win16 until Win32<br>becomes widely available. <br>

1	As far as I know, the "speed buffering"<br>works OK for external modems if a 550 is used on the internal serial<br>port board.	However, I can tell you to stay clear of any board which uses the<br>Rockwell MPU (as opposed to the DPU) for an internal implementation.<br>This is because the MPU used "speed buffering" instead of having a<br>16550 interface.  Without the 550 interface, the number of interrupts<br>are still the same and thus may get dropped under multitasking<br>conditions (like in windows).  As far as I know, the "speed buffering"<br>works OK for external modems if a 550 is used on the internal serial<br>port board.<br><br>Hope this helps...<br>Tom<br>

0	Try to locate the UART on your mother board, multi-function I/O card, COM<br>board or ISA/MCA modem card.	re: What to do after the high speed modem arrives.       Edition 01 Apr 93<br><br>This article applies only to Windows 3.0 and 3.1, and not to NT, OS/2<br>or DOS apps not running under Windows.<br><br>One of the unadvertised limitations of most current Windows PCs is that<br>their RS-232C (serial, COM) performance is seriously deficient.  Almost<br>everyone who purchases a high-speed modem (V.32bis, V.32, PEP or HST)<br>discovers the problem the first time they try to download a file or accept<br>an incoming FAX (at 9600+) after upgrading the modem.  Overrun and retry<br>errors abound, even when the only active application is the datacomm or<br>FAX program.  If the transfer completes at all, it may take even longer<br>than with the old 2400bps modem.<br><br><br>There are three reasons for the problem:<br><br>1. The Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitters (UARTs) used in most<br>   PCs are primitive Ns8250 devices with single-byte FIFO buffers.  If the<br>   operating system/driver cannot read and flush each character at high<br>   interrupt rates, the next incoming character overwrites the FIFO and<br>   the previous one is lost.  DOS, being a fairly single-minded<br>   environment during datacomm, can usually keep up. Windows can't.<br><br>2. Windows has more operating system overhead than plain DOS, and<br>   interrupts often take longer to service.  Overruns are much more likely<br>   than under DOS.  As soon as you report to your PC/modem vendor that you<br>   are losing data, you may be advised that "you need to upgrade to a<br>   16550". More likely, since there seems to be a conspiracy of ignorance<br>   about this issue,  you'll get no useful advice at all.  Most of the<br>   store-front and mail-order sources I spoke with in attempting to solve<br>   my own problem had never heard the term "16550" and many didn't even<br>   know what a UART was.<br><br>3. Even your PC has Ns16550A UARTs (and PS/2's do), or if you can upgrade<br>   your mother/COM board or add a new COM board, you may STILL experience<br>   errors and overruns because the standard MicroSoft Windows COM drivers<br>   don't take full advantage of the 16550.  Windows 3.1 is improved in this<br>   regard over 3.0, but I still recommend a driver upgrade.  Applications<br>   like ProComm+/Win (which is what I use) cannot get around this problem<br>   by themselves.<br><br>If you have a modem CARD, you may not have a problem, as the modem part of<br>the card can be designed to be aware of the state of the UART, and avoid<br>overrunning it; however, I wouldn't want to bet that the card designers<br>were that clever, and will insist on a 16550 UART if I ever buy a modem<br>card.  Some modem cards don't even have conventional UARTs, but if they<br>are to work with standard Windows drivers, they need to simulate one.<br>Use MSD.EXE (below) to see what the modem card is, or is pretending to be.<br><br><br>The Hardware Situation.<br><br>The UARTs on most PC COM ports are based on National Semiconductor Ns8250<br>or Ns16450 chips (or megacells inside VLSI chips where you can't replace<br>them).  You can ID the UART type on your system by running the MicroSoft<br>diagnostic program \WINDOWS\MSD.EXE.  Be sure to run it in DOS *before*<br>bringing up Windows.   The Windows serial API may prevent MSD from<br>accurately identifying a 16550 if you run it from a Windows DOS prompt.<br><br>The Ns16550 UART has separate 16-byte transmit and receive FIFOs with<br>configurable trigger levels, and can run reliably at clock rates up to<br>460,800 bps, although with current modem technology, there's no point in<br>pushing your luck by going over 115,200 bps. The 16550 has shorted access<br>cycle times than the 16450 or 8250.  The 16550 also has DMA capability, but<br>it is not clear that any PC drivers ever use this.  For more technical info,<br>see National Semiconductor Application Note AN-491.<br><br>So, what UART component do you have?<br><br>Try to locate the UART on your mother board, multi-function I/O card, COM<br>board or ISA/MCA modem card.  If you can't find a socketed component with<br>the numbers "8250" or "16450", your COM ports are probably buried in VLSI,<br>and you won't be able to perform a chip replacement.  If you can DISABLE<br>your VLSI COM ports (as I chose to do), you can at least add an aftermarket<br>COM board.<br><br>If you have one or more socketed 8250 or 16450 chips, you can buy plug-in<br>Ns16550AFN or PC16C550CN (low power CMOS version) ICs from several<br>suppliers typically for $9 to $15 each.  The "N" chip is the normal 40-pin<br>dual-in-line package.  Other styles are available, but avoid any Ns16550<br>chips without the "A" (the 16C550C are presumably all OK).<br><br>Early Ns chips have bugs, although National will reportedly exchange those<br>of their own manufacture for free.  Clone chips are available from various<br>IC makers other than National.  The manual for the TurboCom drivers states<br>support for the following (apparently equivalent) chips:<br>National Semiconductor: 16550A, 16551, 16552<br>Chips&Technology:       82C607<br>Texas Instruments:      t16c550a<br>Silicon Systems:        73M550<br>VLSI                    16C550<br>TurboCom warns about the pre-"A" Ns16550 and Western Digital 16C550,<br>says that problems have been reported with early IBM PS/2 55SX and 70<br>systems (IBM reportedly will upgrade them).<br><br>If you DON'T have socketed 8250/16450 chips, you'll need to buy an after-<br>market COM or multi-function board. If this is a modem card situation, you<br>may be hosed. To add a new COM or multi-function card, you'll need to<br>either disable the COM1/2 port(s) you are replacing, or re-assign them to<br>COM3/4 (although watch out for IRQ conflicts without TurboCom).<br><br>Although cheaper cards are available, in the interest of getting the<br>problem solved quickly I elected buy the Modular Circuit Technology<br>MCT-AIO+ card from:<br><br>JDR Microdevices<br>2233 Samaritan Drive<br>San Jose  CA  95124<br>(800) 538-5000 voice US<br>(408) 559-1200 voice other<br>(800) 538-5005 FAX US<br><br>The MCT-AIO+ (and the "+" is important) sells for $89.95.

The standard MS serial drivers don't take full advantage of the<br>16550. The Windows 3.0 drivers are even less capable, and the Windows 3.1<br>drivers have the following limitations:<br> - They enable only the receive FIFO, and only at rates above 2400 bps.<br> - They never enable the transmit FIFO, which  results in an interrupt<br>   rate of 10x during uploads.<br> - They set the trigger level at 14 bytes (too high - it's easy for 2<br>   more bytes to arrive before the driver can read the FIFO).<br> - The Ports menu of the Control Panel only allows speeds up to 19200.<br>   With a V.32bis modem,  sparse data and text can easily compress 3:1<br>   or more, suggesting that a host DTE connect rate of 57,600 bps would<br>   be effective.<br> - The API won't accept rates above "CBR_128000".<br> - The API won't let DOS programs know there is a 16550 there, and even<br>   if it did, DOS programs that aren't 16550-aware get little benefit<br>   from a 16550 port with the standard drivers.<br> - They don't allow IRQ sharing for COM3,4.<br> - The BIOS doesn't initialize COM3,4 properly in many systems.<br> - Windows provides no workaround for apps that don't provide port<br>   speed options above 19200 bps.<br><br>These problems are reportedly NOT solved in Windows NT or DOS 6.0, and may<br>or may not be addressed in any Windows releases after 3.1 (but before 4.0).<br>Rumors suggest they "may" be solved in Windows "4.0".<br><br>You can get replacement drivers that solve all of those problems by buying<br>a copy of "TurboCom", current version 1.2, from:<br><br>Bio-Engineering Research<br>Pacific CommWare Division<br>180 Beacon Hill Lane<br>Ashland  OR   97520-9701<br>(503) 482-2744 voice<br>(503) 482-2627 FAX<br>(503) 482-2633 BBS<br>MCImail:    344-5374<br>CompuServe: 71521,760<br><br>Price was around $50 as I recall.

TurboCom gets<br>around this by allowing you to specify, on each port, a factor that will<br>set the real UART rate to a multiple of the rate passed through the<br>Windows APIs and dialog boxes.<br><br>I also have CTS/RTS hardware flow control enabled, and I suggest that you<br>do the same.  Even if you only ever transfer 7-bit ASCII data, Xon/XOff is<br>not a sufficiently reliable method of flow control.  The informal (DEC)<br>standard for Xon/Xoff hysteresis is that the sender may transmit another<br>16 (yes, sixteen) bytes after receipt of the Xoff from the receiving<br>system or device.  The 16 byte FIFO in the 16550 is clearly not big enough<br>to let us rely exclusively on Xon/Xoff.  A well-respected datacomm<br>engineer has informed me that the 16550's can't really do CTS/RTS all<br>by itself in the DOS/Windows environment, so using data rates above<br>115,200 may still be risky.<br><br>Even with hardware flow control, a 16550 with TurboCom can still<br>experience overruns in very busy systems, with lots of apps running and<br>serious swapping in progress. If this is your situation, you may need to<br>buy a co-processed COM board, but this will cost you more than a<br>16550/TurboCom upgrade.  A review of two such boards, and a review of<br>TurboCom, can be found in the Feb'93 issue of "Windows Sources" magazine.<br>I suggest trying a 16550/TurboCom upgrade first, and experiment with<br>process priorities and time slices if you are a "power user" whose<br>thrashing system still runs into comm problems.<br><br><br>Closing Soapbox Comments<br><br>The state of RS-232C serial datacomm support is an embarrassment across<br>the computer industry.  Because it is the oldest standard I/O interface,<br>the job of designing hardware and writing software often seems to be<br>assigned to the least senior or lowest ranked engineers at computer<br>companies.  The design of the average serial port is at least ten years<br>behind the state of the art. In my last job, with a major workstation<br>vendor, I lobbied for improved serial ports when they were doing the<br>initial designs of a new system.

Few computer companies seem to have any champions for decent<br>I/O.<br><br>You may as well learn what you can about serial I/O, because this<br>situation shows no sign of improving soon.  When V.FAST arrives, I expect<br>cries of outrage from Windows users world-wide whose 8250 PCs "sort of"<br>work today with V.32, but will fail miserably with V.FAST.  Without a<br>hardware-buffered UART (like the 16550) and without software drivers that<br>use that UART to best advantage, a V.FAST modem will be a waste of money.<br><br>Regards,                                          1001-A East Harmony Road<br>Bob Niland                                        Suite 503<br>Internet:  rjn@csn.org                            Fort Collins CO 80525<br>CompuServe: 71044,2124                            (303) 223-5209<br><br>                     Copyright 1993 Robert J.

About<br>  1/2 the speed, as I recall.<br><br>  The big question for me is the Orchid V9000 card.  Each of the <br>  P9000 cards tested so far has had the W5186 to do VGA.  Orchid<br>  is the only one I know about (I don't know about AMI) that uses<br>  the W5286 for VGA.  That is reportedly faster.<br>  <br>  I would like to know whether the Orchid card can do VGA as fast as<br>  the ATI card.  If so, it would appear to be a formidable competitor.<br>  (Advertised prices are about the same for the two cards.)<br><br>Someone in this group posted a little while back that they were getting an<br>Orchid V9000 card -- has that card arrived?  What do the benchmarks look<br>like?<br><br>Also, is the AMI P9000-based card real?  What does it use for VGA?  Speed?

1	Not _any_ difference.	I have a Maxtor 212MB on an ISA IDE controller, although my machine is<br>DX2/66 VLB. I has the save transfer rate of 0.647 MB/s regardless of<br>the variations of the ISA bus speed. I tested it with speed between<br>5.5MHz and 8.33MHz. Not _any_ difference.

1	LED's:   (Turbo and HD)  LED's are uni directional.	The speaker connector should have two wires going to the speaker. <br>A speaker being a coil, it's bidirectional and makes no difference<br>which way you attach.<br><br>Turbo switch.   There are three wires to control how you want turbo<br>to become active- with the switch pushed in or the switch out.    I think<br>the middle wire is common.   Use an ohm meter to figure out which wire<br>connects with the common wire when the switch is pushed in, and which two<br>wires are connected when the switch is out.   Place the appropriate<br>two wires on the turbo berg connector of the motherboard.<br><br>LED's:   (Turbo and HD)  LED's are uni directional.  Depending which<br>way the wires are attached the LED will not light.  On my AMI motherboard,<br>if the turbo switch wires are not attached to the berg connector on the<br>board, the board will power up in default in Turbo mode.   If your motherboard<br>is like that... just attace the LED wires to the board.  If the LED doesn't<br>light, power off, reverse the connectors and try again.   It should work.<br><br>If it does, then attach the turbo switch to the board.<br><br>Hope this helps.
1	This is a bit long.	 I have a similar configuration: Colorado 250mb on 66 DX/2 tower.<br><br><br><br> You got suckered in the same way I did.  Silly me, believing<br> that the "250" logo on the front meant actual carrying capacity.<br> The people who do this sort of thing for a living call it <br> "marketing."  Lawyers who prosecute it call it "fraud."<br> Perhaps we can have a bunch of other duped buyers march on <br> their corporate headquarters.<br><br><br> This is a bit long.  My system takes about 45 minutes to do <br> the same thing.  Usually 4.5 hours, particularly if the tape <br> is grinding away the whole time means that your block size for <br> the write is too small.  Is there any way to change the block <br> size or write buffer size so it's bigger?<br><br><br> This is because the files are opened by DOS.  The files in the <br> TAPE directory are likely the executable file or the configuration<br> file for the tape system.  I would recommend running the backup<br> from DOS so it will make a complete backup of the TAPE directory.<br><br><br> The 250mb cartridges won't do you any good since the drive<br> won't write 250mb of physical data on the tape.  <br><br>

1	But if there are already two drives, then no can do.	There is a simple answer.  If my memory serves me the scsi bios will only<br>work as the first or second drive.  Any "built-in" drives e.g. IDE are<br>installed first and then when the scsi bios runs it will try to install<br>as the next drive.  But if there are already two drives, then no can do.<br><br>The solution is simple: use the aspi4dos device driver and disable the<br>scsi bios (as it is useless in your case).  It works like a champ!  I<br>have seen a similar situation before.<br><br>Good Luck

Sure, both will allow you double warranty on computers, but Citibank<br>has a maximum claim of $250.00.  Could you imagine trying to get your<br>monitor or mother board fixed for $250.00?  Amex has NO limit on claims.<br><br>Remember, if you use Amex, you must either send a copy of the warranty info<br>to them in 30 days from purchase, or you must call them to pre-register and<br>then send them the paperwork within 90 days of purchase (my pre-register<br>pak arrived today).  Citibank VISA requires no pre-registration.

1	--	I read a recent article in Personal Computer World mainly about the new<br>digit audion formats (DCC and MD) but at the end talked about how nice<br>it would be to use these for data storage with a brief calculation of<br>how much data you could store. The author had been talking to someone<br>from Sony about these formats and mentioned this to get the reply "MD<br>is a purely audio format, we wouldn't use it for data", then when<br>pressed for info about MO the Sony man basically admitted that it was<br>no more than a slight adaptabtion on MD!<br><br>What I think the original poster was wanting was MO drives at MD audio<br>player prices.

The particular need in this case is for three machines, each in a<br>different office of the same building, each having access to a<br>Windows-based accounting system.<br><br>My first thought is to set up MS Windows for Workgroups on each of the<br>machines (likely a 486 and two 386's) along with the appropriate Ethernet<br>cards and cabling that come with the Windows for Workgroups starter kit (one<br>additional user kit will be necessary).

1	(Now if it just KEEPS working).	   Upon unboxing it I found everything to be in perfect order. All the <br>peripherals I ordered were properly installed (Jumbo-250 & CD-ROM). I<br>was very impressed with the quantity and quality of the Gateway <br>documentation. All software came with the original disks and manuals.<br>The Gateway manual itself is in a nice 3-ring binder. The ATI GUP came<br>with build59 drivers. All other software I specified (Microsoft Office)<br>was properly installed. The machine came right up out of the box and <br>has been performing flawlessly. It's been on all weekend and it hardly<br>even reaches room temperature. I think the big roomy tower case has a <br>lot to do with it. <br><br>   It's up and running DOS 6.0 with no problems. I've also read about<br>some people having problems with high speed serial communications. <br>I used the DOS 6.0 InterLink program which lets me link to my old<br>computer via a serial port at 115.2K baud. It then "maps" the other<br>machines two hard disks as my disks F & G. You can "cd" to these<br>drives and either run programs or copy files. It's almost like a<br>peer-peer lan except you can also *run* programs on the other machine.<br>It's not a two way street. The other machine is the server and this<br>machine is the client. So thats where it seems to differ from the <br>peer to peer stuff. For a bundled DOS utility its very impressive. <br><br>  My Jumbo-250 took about 11 minutes to back up 117MB of data. I also<br>by-passed any potential Gateway monitor problems by taking the $430<br>credit and applying it towards a NEC 4FG. I love this monitor!<br><br>  So, I'm glad there is some good news Gateway stories and I'm glad it<br>was me. (Now if it just KEEPS working). :-)<br><br><br>     John<br><br>

0	i.e., comp *.	<br>No, we're not.  But we're also not going to promote pandering to<br>corporate paranoia when the real issue is convenience.  I don't *like*<br>dealing with floppies.  Personally, I have no use for changing the<br>registration info, but I see it as a valid need, and one that ought to<br>be solved using a quick little utility rather than a half-hour<br>reinstall that's just about guaranteed to mess up your settings in one<br>way or another.<br><br>So, while I'm not going to put much time into it myself, here's the<br>procedure for getting on your way to finding the encoded information:<br><br>1.  Copy all your Windows disks into the directory from which you want<br>to install it.  I've been using c:\WINSTALL myself.<br><br>2.  From there, copy that directory to something like c:\WINORIG.<br><br>3.  Install from c:\winstall.<br><br>4.  comp the two directories to determine changes.  <br>    i.e., comp *.* \winorig\*.* >\report.txt<br><br>5.  Look in the report file for the file(s) that change.  Assuming<br>they didn't cover themselves covering their own tracks, at least one<br>file should have a difference noted at a particular offset.  Locate<br>said offset in the original directory and see what's there using a hex<br>editor, and do the same for the modified one.<br><br>6.  You're on your own as far as breaking the code goes; I don't<br>really do cryptography.  It's probably just an xor key or something; I<br>think MS is more concerned with Joe Schmoe at the office personalizing<br>his copy than with "real pirates" who will probably just disassemble<br>the damned thing anyway.  This technique should work with just about<br>any obnoxious corporate product that tries to write to the original<br>floppies when you install; in some extreme cases you may not be able<br>to back the floppies up to hard disk, and will be stuck doing a<br>compare on floppies (Lotus stuff is probably like that).<br><br>As I noted before, if you can afford the space on the hard disk, and<br>don't do much in the way of customization, reinstalling from one<br>directory to another may be less arduous.  Doing some of the stuff<br>I've mentioned here may well void your license with Microsoft, as if<br>they'd ever find out.  If you aren't careful with the disk editor, you<br>could also mung something important... duh.  I guess that's a<br>disclaimer.<br><br>Have at it....<br><br>Rob

0	Thanks to all of you that<br>replied.	I had posted some questions regarding the new ATI Ultra Pro cards and<br>had asked confirmation of some opinions.<br><br>This message is a summary of the responses. Thanks to all of you that<br>replied.<br><br><br><br>a) The higher memory limits apply to ISA cards only, as far as I know.  The VLB<br>   and EISA version should have no problems.<br> <br>b) I'm pretty sure from my experience that the ISA version doesn't<br>   work in systems with over 16M Ram.  There is supposed to be way<br>   of switching the "memory aperture" feature off to prevent this,<br>   but apparently it doesn't work.  I posted some "help me" messages<br>   on the net and people indicated that the EISA card didn't have this<br>   problem.<br><br>c) FALSE<br><br>d) The VLB card, which I have, allows you to set memory aperture over 32M<br>   by using their configuration software.  No messing with jumpers necessary.<br><br>   The 32M problem is probably valid only for ISA cards.<br><br><br><br>a) Again, the memory aperture need only be disabled if you have more than 124M RAM<br>   (EISA and VLB) or 12 M (ISA).  32M should not be a problem for you. <br> <br>b) Dunno.<br><br>c) Depends on the bus. YES if ISA, NO if EISA or Localbus<br><br><br><br>a) Nope.  I can use 640x480 at 72hz, 24-bit and 800x600 at 70hz, 24-bit, all<br>   non-interlaced.<br><br>b) Yes - According to PC Magazine, they've tested a local bus version<br>   that does 1024x768 in 24-bit which may or may not be interlaced.<br><br>c) Not for the Pro. Sometimes for the Plus.<br><br>   Some modes may run only interlaced on certain monitors. This has nothing to <br>   do with 24 bits ... only with screen size. Note that for 24 bit color<br>   and Windows you MUST have 2 megs, memory size calculations notwithstanding.<br><br><br><br>a) They aren't perfect, but are much improved.  I don't recall the last time which<br>   I had to leave mach 32 mode (ATI GUP mode) and switch to 8514 or VGA mode due<br>   to software incompatibility.<br><br>b) True.  Many people recommended going back to Build 55 or 54.<br><br>c) They appear to be excellent, but have a few bugs. For example, certain<br>   graphs with dashed lines in Mathcad 3.1 do not print correctly, though they<br>   do display OK on the screen. They are about par for fancy cards ..<br>   other accelerated cards also have bugs.<br><br>d) Overall, I like the card, even if driver performance is somewhat less than<br>   satisfactory.  I am running the 1024*768 16 Color mode as that is all my<br>   NT driver for October NT version seems to allow.<br><br>   I will say this that Color performance is not quite as nice as a Diamond<br>   Stealth VRAM, but I have not been able to try out a lot of the options on<br>   the old driver.<br><br><br><br>a) It's quite fast, but whether or not its the fastest is open to debate.<br> <br>b) Yes - I'll admit it was very very fast in 16-bit mode, which is what<br>   I wanted to use it for.  Too bad it crashed (in many different ways)<br>   every 20 minutes or so...<br><br>c) Depends on many many things.<br><br><br><br>a) I like it.<br><br>b) Well - PC Magazine seems to think it is.<br><br>c) Yes, this appears to be true :-)<br><br>d) As to greatest thing since sliced bread, I doubt it.  Better cards are<br>   coming out.  Who knows, maybe ATI will come out with something faster yet.<br>   Several reviews I read rated one Pycon Winjet card as a superior performer <br>   at a cheaper price except for availability of drivers, which Pycon was <br>   developing at that time.  (PC Magazine, about two months or so back)<br><br>   Overall, the card has a lot of potential, but you have to be able to use it.<br> <br><br>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>That is the end of the questions. These were the most discussed items in this<br>group so I thought they needed confirmation.

0	You can have thousands of glyphs in a TT font<br> file (Mac/PS/Windows/Unicode char set) and use the characters<br> appropriate for the particular platform you are running the font on.	 Again, not true. The characters in a TT or Type 1 font depend on the <br> maker. If someone converts a Type 1 font to TT they'll only get the<br> characters in the font of orgin. TT allows for much more flexibility<br> in this area as well. You can have thousands of glyphs in a TT font<br> file (Mac/PS/Windows/Unicode char set) and use the characters<br> appropriate for the particular platform you are running the font on.<br><br>Well, yes, both Type 1 and TrueType fonts can contain lots of characters.<br>And in both cases plain text fonts will be reencoded to Windows ANSI<br>in Windows, and to Mac standard roman encoding on the Mac. <br>No difference there between T1 and TT!   <br><br>And as for fonts with thousands of glyphs, right know these are a liabiliaty<br>rather than a great new thing.  Reason is that a font with 3000 characters<br>is very large, and if you can only access 224 of them you are paying a heavy<br>price in downloading time and printer storage.  (And at the moment there<br>is only one program of that uses `partial font downloading')<br><br> For instance, all or our fontpack 2 TT fonts have the Mac/Windows<br> char set in them. The metrics of the fonts are such that if the font<br> is brought over to the mac the user will have access to the full mac<br> char set.  <br><br>Yes and T1 text fonts all have the `ISO Adobe' character set, which is<br>a superset of Windows ANSI and Macintosh standard roman enocding.<br><br>The question is whether you can get at the glyphs.  In Windows, for example,<br>you cannot get at the ligatures `fi' anfd `fl' (both T1 and TT)even though a<br>font may very well have them.<br><br>ANd, while it is somewhat painful to reencode a Type 1 font and to create a<br>new Windows metric file (PFM) for it, there are utilities out there to allow<br>you do this.  How do I reencode a TrueType font?  How can I get at the<br>`fi' and `fl' ligatures in Windows (or on the Mac)?  Are there utilities<br>that make it possible to circumvent the hard-wired Windows ANSI encoding?<br><br><br>   > Regards,                                            1001-A East Harmony Road<br>   > Bob Niland                                          Suite 503<br>   > Internet:  rjn@csn.org                              Fort Collins CO 80525<br>   > CompuServe: 71044,2124                              (303) 223-5209<br>

1	So my question is, do the AT RAM boards that plug into a free slot work  <br>well with a 486 ISA machine.	 I have a 486sx25 ISA machine with Pheonix BIOS.  Currently I have  <br>8 megabytes of RAM installed via eight 1 MG SIMMS on the motherboard: ie.  <br>both banks are full, and there is no space for more SIMMS.  I am thinking  <br>of running OS2 on my machine and Possibly Linux with X windows, and I know  <br>that more RAM would be helpful.  However with SIMMS, the only solution I  <br>can see is to sell my 8 Megs for about $180, and by 4 4mg SIMMS for about  <br>$400 used. Apart from the fact that I can't afford the price right now,  <br>the entire process of selling RAM and buying it used probably means that  <br>the machine might be down for a number of days which I would rather  <br>avoid...<br><br>So my question is, do the AT RAM boards that plug into a free slot work  <br>well with a 486 ISA machine. I have seen some being sold used for about  <br>$90 with 4 Mg with space for another 4Mg's.  If these boards do work, how  <br>do they do it?

1	Please double-check me on this.	I believe that any VL/EISA/ISA motherboard that uses the HINT chipset<br>is limited to 24-bit EISA DMA (where 'real' EISA DMA is 32-bit).  The<br>HINT EISA DMA has the 16 mb ram addressing limitation of ISA.  For this<br>reason I would pass.  I own one of these (HAWK VL/EISA/ISA) and am look-<br>ing to replace it for exactly this reason.<br><br>Please double-check me on this.  In other words, call the motherboard<br>manufacturer and ask them if the motherboard supports true 32-bit EISA<br>DMA.<br><br>Other than this limitation, the motherboard works quite well (I am using<br>mine with DOS 5, Windows 3.1, and UNIX S5R3.2).  Also with Adaptec 1742a<br>EISA SCSI host adapter.<br>

The first attempt failed in the summer<br> of 1992 (the voting deadline was August 31, 1992).  The voting rules<br> state that another attempt for creating newsgroups can be started<br> after a six month waiting period (in this case, it is March 1, 1993).<br> This is the first attempt at creating comp.os.os2.multimedia and<br> comp.os.os2.bugs.<br><br> This document contains:<br> *  the background showing the need for these proposals<br> *  the proposed charters for these proposals<br> *  voting instructions<br> *  a voting ballot<br> *  some example ballots<br> *  the voting rules<br> *  the voting schedule<br> *  the Mass Acknowledgement<br><br><br>Background:<br><br> The creation of two, free, 32-bit compilers for OS/2 2.x (gcc/2<br> and emx/gcc; read comp.os.os2.programmer for details) has spurred<br> a continuing deluge of software ported from UNIX platforms, such<br> as emacs, less, awk, grep, sed, xscheme, ispell, flex, yacc, and<br> much more.  Borland has released its C/C++ compiler for OS/2 2.x,<br> allowing for easier porting of DOS and Windows software.<br><br> Much of the PC hardware and drivers were written for DOS, and<br> later, Windows.  As more people are discovering OS/2 2.x, the<br> number of people asking questions about OS/2's compatibility<br> with their hardware increases, as does the questions on the<br> availability of drivers for their hardware, installation<br> procedures, etc.<br><br> Multimedia is becoming popular.  OS/2 2.0 supports Windows<br> Multimedia Extensions using Win-OS/2 3.0.  Furthermore, IBM is<br> including direct multimedia support in OS/2 starting with version<br> 2.1 (in addition to using Win-OS/2 3.1).<br><br> Any non-trivial software will have bugs -- OS/2 is not exempt,<br> especially since IBM is constantly adding new features to OS/2.<br> So far, IBM has issued system patches and corrective service disks<br> (e.g.  the Service Pak) for free (free from BBSs and ftp sites, or<br> for free plus a small media charge for diskettes -- read<br> comp.os.os2.misc for details).<br><br><br>Proposed Charters:<br><br> (a)  create comp.os.os2.programmer.porting (unmoderated)<br><br>  It will provide a forum for developers of ported software so<br>  as to coordinate efforts, avoid duplication of effort, and<br>  spur additional development.  The group will also cover<br>  topics such as porting from other platforms (such as DOS,<br>  Windows, UNIX, etc), toolkits which aid in program<br>  portability (including porting tools such as Mirrors), and<br>  so forth.<br><br> (b)  rename: comp.os.os2.programmer.misc (unmoderated)<br><br>  To keep the structure of the OS/2 newsgroup heirarchy<br>  orthogonal, comp.os.os2.programmer should be renamed to<br>  comp.os.os2.programmer.misc.<br><br>  comp.os.os2.programmer.misc will still be the newsgroup<br>  for OS/2 programmers to discuss programming issues and<br>  technical aspects of OS/2 in an unmoderated setting.<br><br> (c)  create comp.os.os2.setup (unmoderated)<br><br>  It will be devoted to OS/2 system setup topics, including the<br>  availability of device drivers, compatibility information,<br>  installation procedures, system requirements, and overall<br>  performance optimization.<br><br> (d)  create comp.os.os2.multimedia (unmoderated)<br><br>  It will provide a forum for discussion of multi-media issues.<br><br> (e)  create comp.os.os2.bugs (unmoderated)<br><br>  It will provide a forum for OS/2 system bug reports, bug<br>  diagnosis and work arounds, the availability of system<br>  patches and corrective service disks, and so forth.<br><br>  [Note that discussion of bugs in applications belong in other<br>  newsgroups, and discussion of bugs in OS/2 betas belong in<br>  comp.os.os2.beta]<br><br><br>How to Vote:<br><br> To cast your vote, fill out the ballot below and e-mail it to me.<br> Many newsreaders will allow e-mail to be sent by replying to this<br> post.

0	I highly<br>recommend using a proper _soft_ mouse pad, and if you are a clean freak,<br>place it in your drawer every night or when you don't use it to keep<br>the dust off.	Try this:  flip your mouse over, and open up the cover that holds the<br>mouse ball in place.  Remove the ball, and inside you should see<br>(probably) 3 rollers.  If any of the rollers have a tiny layer of<br>caked-on dirt, dust, or otherwise unidentifiable scum on them, carefully<br>scrape it off with a small knife (Xacto works great).  *Be Careful*<br>You do not want to gauge the rollers, just clean off the dirt.<br>Put the ball back in, put the cover on, and there you are.  <br><br>I clean a couple of dozen of these every month here.  Another symptom<br>is that when you move the mouse, it seems to "click" along.  If this<br>doesn't solve your problem, at least you have a clean mouse.  I highly<br>recommend using a proper _soft_ mouse pad, and if you are a clean freak,<br>place it in your drawer every night or when you don't use it to keep<br>the dust off.<br><br>Personally I prefer track balls.  Oh, which brings me to another point:<br>if your mouse or trackball tracks optically, and the sunlight is <br>streaming through the window onto your mouse/trackball, you may notice<br>that it will stop working.  If this happens to you, close the curtains<br>or blinds, or simply shade your pointing device, and see if that helps.<br>

1	Some disks that won't DISKCOPY<br>properly can be readily Teledisk'd into the proper format...<br>At least this is a software solution for a hardware/BIOS <br>deficiency, eh?	Another (albeit strange) option is using a program like 800 II<br>(available via anonymous FTP at many major sites), or FDFORMAT<br>(also available via anonymous FTP), that allows you to format<br>5.25HD disks to 1.44Meg, or 3.5"HD disks to 1.2Meg (along with<br>many MANY other formats!) so you can DISKCOPY (yes, the broken<br>MeSsy-DOS DISKCOPY!) the 5.25" disks onto 3.5" disks or vice<br>versa...  I use this techniques with "NON-DOS" self-booting <br>game disks on my old Tandy 1000, and it works...  Another program<br>named Teledisk (shareware--available on many major BBS's) will<br>also make the weird format disks, provided you have 800 II<br>or FDFormat installed....

Is<br>  there anybody from Borland ? Is there any e-mail address that we can <br>  contact the technical support ? Not for stupid questions, but to ask<br>  for example, why the RW manual seems to be different from the RW itself ?<br>- Is there anybody else using it around here ?<br>- Will the book of Petzold be useful for me ?

0	But if users forget to delete some related files, the disk will be full<br>    of nonsense files.	  Days ago people doubted that ms-windows is not a real OS. I can see why<br>they have such question. Ms-windows confuses many people. Microsoft<br>simulated Mac, but it did a lousy job.  For example:<br><br>(1) You can not create hierarchy groups. There is no way to create a group<br>    in a group. (If you know how, please tell me.)<br>(2) Too many system parameters to take care of. <br>(3) uncomplete documentation. It's not easy to find the reason why causes<br>    an unpredictable error.<br>(4) Group deleting/file deleting<br>    After deleting a group, users have to use file manager to delete files.<br>    But if users forget to delete some related files, the disk will be full<br>    of nonsense files.<br>(5) share problem<br>    Once you create two windows doing compilation and editing in some<br>    language (w/o good editor), there will be a sharing problem. You just<br>    can not open or save the program if it is loaded. It makes sense to<br>    prevent from saving, but not opening.<br><br>Microsoft try to compromise between DOS and windows, but they just make <br>ms-windows a graphical DOS with capacity doing mutiple DOS jobs; <br>the worst thing is they complicate the environment. The orginal purpose<br>of ms-windows should be to simplify the environment, and make PC easier <br>to use.<br>  <br>  It's by no means easy to satisfy everybody, but if Microsoft want to<br>keep their reputations, they should evaluate the user interface more<br>carefully before products distribute.<br><br>  No flame, please.
